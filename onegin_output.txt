“My darling, growing old am I!
Imagine! Here alone am I!
Each other as the shore we climb!
What! really going? ’Tis too bad!
For patience, reader, I must plead!
’Tis finished. Horrible to read!
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
As if he cruelly had joked!
To kiss the feet which I admired!
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
How much is in that word expressed!
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!
Into thy hands my fate I yield!
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
With the “Well-Wisher” in her hand!
“Oh! nurse, nurse, you don’t understand!
The thunderbolt on you descend!
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
Become alarmed. So never mind!
Funeral amateurs abound!
A beau is for Tattiana found!
But suddenly all changed around!
Will happiness replace. My God!
As to a worthy man and good!
And spur my spirit’s torpid mood!
Lessons to give he understood!
How I have erred and felt the rod!
Lo! my Onéguine rural lord!
He mused: “I will her saviour be!
As many entertainments be!
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Depicted on your haughty face!
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
The days of love and of romance!
Oh! what had been his eminence!
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
My soul is filled with gratitude!
The poet’s hour hath sounded—See!
To part in amity with thee!
From henceforth I confide to thee!
By Providence’s dark decree!
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
A mansion—by the window, see!
Gallop, mazurka, waltzing—see!
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
A paragon of virtue he!
She oped her eyes and cried: ’tis he!
And cried within myself: ’tis he!
She sits alone—’tis ever she!
On such a day. O Heavens, ’tis she!
Great sacrifices for his sake!
“Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
Howl like a dolt: ’tis meant for me!
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
I am in love, my hour hath come!
When will my hour of freedom come!
With many a snare their pathway line!
In one great shout: she’s mine! she’s mine!
Good-night.” Behold! she is alone!
Waiting his coming—his alone!
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
“Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
On horseback gallop o’er the steppe!
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
“He’s here! Eugene is here!
I promised!—Did I so?—Well, there!
And lo! he is already there!
Just as he entered. How severe!
Raged round him and of balked desire!
“Who would have thought it? As of yore!
“Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
Felled a calumniator base!
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
On thee I used to meditate!
All so distinct, and all so white!
And madrigals I’m asked to write!
To shallow sentiment a slave!
The Lord deliver her and save!
“Not at all.”—“That I can’t conceive!
Of “comme il faut.” Shishkòff, forgive!
And loves you as—a relative!
None, be my witness Heaven above!
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
“Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
Onéguine’s letter!”—“Ah! the thing!
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
The world is ever altering!
His entrance with Onéguine. “Ah!
Make up your mind to go there.”—“Ah!
Society endures not such!
With great delight.—O God on high!
List! the snow crunches—he draws nigh!
How dark the night is getting though!
My venerated reader, oh!
They sent their compliments—but oh!
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
Bruin is marching at her back!
Passes the torrent But alack!
And he had made her heart beat quick!
He enters the saloon. ’Tis blank!
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
Which crushing dignity must brook!
How thoroughly her part she took!
Her glance how wild yet genial!
And others rise ephemeral!
A substitute for lamps we hail!
Exclaiming, “We must change ’em all!
To take this letter to O— Well!
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
At eighteen not to play the fool!
She waited for—I don’t know whom!
E sempre bene, gentlemen!
A friendly hand thy life hath ta’en!
How deftly could he transport feign!
Thine honour is my countersign!
For God’s sake, Lenski, don’t begin!
Behold! the world’s opinion!
The hero is of my narration!
My very latest composition!
And the fair sex as light as down!
Still happier he who ne’er hath known!
More troublesome than usual?”—“No!
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Made me so tipsy long ago!
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
His daily occupations, lo!
I cannot understand. But lo!
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
Girls in anticipation skip!
Come to my golden palace, dear!
But as to fighting—’twill appear!
“At Làrina’s.”—“Hem, that is queer!
Confront thy fated torturer!
On waves by tempests curdled o’er!
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Onéguine fired—Alas! alas!
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
I’ve had to make for having friends!
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
And deem the world perfection is!
“Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
A horse’s hoofs she hears—She shrinks!
But to Onéguine! A propos!
Nearer they come—Eugene appears!
Tattiana in the young princess!
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
How mean, how pusillanimous!
For otherwise—God only knows!
But even thus not now-a-days!
And cry: he was a poet great!
My friends, the poet ye regret!
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Obsequious or indifferent!
’Tis time she to the altar went!
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
The indignation of her heart!
A lancer captivates her heart!
The fashionable rhymester’s heart!
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
Ah! I’m so weak—my throbbing breast!
For every loyal Russian breast!
A new world was made manifest!
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
But you must both be quite tired out!
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The God of Love is after you!
Had reconciled the pair anew!
How full of fire his speech would glow!
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
How charming Olga’s shoulders grow!
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
“’Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
And well-instructed to betray!
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
Descried before me suddenly!
You’ll spend your winter famously!
Wallow, my friends, in company!
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
This, this were true felicity!
Hears not my importunity!
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Device of rural minds acute!)
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
By time (who can anticipate?)
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
(One and the same thing it may be)
To see aught—never mind meanwhile)
(Like other things I could relate)
(Mechanically, let us add),
In your young days and also mine),
(I speak not of our poems here),
(See the first canto if ye will),
And usually despised it too),
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
For maiden’s hearing deemed unfit),
(This joking I used to protest),
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Ye billows of blue Hadria’s sea,
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
And I, remembering Svetlana,
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
He writes upon his parents’ tomb,
The inmate is for ever dumb,
He oft upon his lips would curb,
He found them in an almanac,
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
Shaking with serious air the head,
Now of a family the head,
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
I slumber much, a little read,
Some nice instructive novel read,
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
An idle anchorite and sad,
Still certain authors, I may add,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
’Tis time for supper, now for bed,
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
The workpeople she superintended,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
Vice had due punishment awarded,
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
His uncle, busy man indeed,
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Had run across her path at speed,
And all with one accord agreed,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
On the dull stage find all things changed,
The wedding-day had been arranged,
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Just at that time his father died,
Customs by ages sanctified,
A visionary mortified,
But in his heart dissatisfied,
“Alack! Tattiana,” she replied,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
The new moon’s crescent slim she spied,
Tattiana’s trouble might have spied,
“I shall expire,” Tattiana cried,
The matter by his conscience tried,
Successfully to please her tried,
Delusions of a mind untried,
He round the billiard-table stalked,
And such unconsciously he led,
A hermit’s life Onéguine led,
This life in masquerade concealed,
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
Repose her silken curtains fled,
The troop of apparitions fled,
Nay! even as this instant fled,
The pains of night have wholly fled,
And with remorseful anguish filled,
A gambling troop when he controlled,
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
A few of different temper deemed,
That our desires which noblest seemed,
A notoriety proclaimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
That, for the century designed,
Made revelations undesigned,
Or even, silent and resigned,
To arid selfishness resigned,
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Once more to idleness consigned,
Have e’er a precious tress consigned,
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
A something somehow have obtained,
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
And handsome countenance combined,
A tender couplet he combined,
With intellect, a taste refined,
At first for books was disinclined,
Anticipating woe she pined,
Though Baratynski verses penned,
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
The maiden’s weary eye which yearned,
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
To his Penates now returned,
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
An explanation: she was scared,
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
Another with cock’s head appeared,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
My image hath not disappeared,
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
In her affairs ne’er interfered,
His soul by crash of music fired,
Singing God knows what maid admired,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
His tea with rum no more desired,
’Tis in your power now, if desired,
And both of dull existence tired,
I long by ballets have been bored,
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Though beauty he no more adored,
His ruffian bravery adored,
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Contented and with victuals stored,
Thus widely meditation erred,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Of the romances she preferred,
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
He who economy abhorred,
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
Rebuffed—as quickly reassured,
A marriageable maid matured,
The shining pistols are uncased,
More timid than a doe long chased,
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
And Fliànoff, somewhat indisposed,
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
In love adventures she was versed,
When all around the entrance pressed,
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
But sits in bed with air depressed,
And kindness Tania was impressed,
Onéguine was the most impressed,
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
But tremor still her frame possessed,
Within that secret court discussed,
By friendship how they were abused,
No signs of trouble her accused,
And though her soul might be confused,
Not that she had his works perused,
In fact, the subject analysed,
Even so! His passions soon abated,
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
By daily life deteriorated,
He might his motives have narrated,
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Awhile this beauty captivated,
His visit she had not awaited,
Of what he thought and what believed,
In vain was youth by us received,
Retained the image, though short-lived,
A new proprietor arrived,
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Onéguine, by first impulse moved,
And as a country damsel roved,
Strictly the Carnival observed,
For first “madame” his wants observed,
A mien unaltered she preserved,
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
The gifted songster never swerved,
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
In company, or simply bowed,
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
And privileges nice allowed,
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
Passion’s wild sway I then allowed,
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Please her by their decorum fixed,
He with his little maiden played,
Eight rubbers were already played,
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
Change of position had essayed,
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
“What is your name?” The boor looked dazed,
She on the apparition gazed,
Again imagination blazed,
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
He found him on the table laid,
The powder in the pan is laid,
Should go, the market for a maid,
In Olga’s album, youthful maid,
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
To classicism I’ve homage paid,
No time to pick it up! afraid,
That bilberry wine, I’m sore afraid,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
“Poor Yorick,” mournfully he said,
Though scarcely following what was said,
As one who bivouacs afield,
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
With an imagination wild,
But that Princess Pauline of old,
I also wandered there of old,
“We never loved in days of old,
And the suspicious veteran old,
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
The morn arises foggy, cold,
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
How empires store of wealth unfold,
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Some marriageable maids behold,
In one he doth accounts behold,
And the young ladies fortunes told,
Of Africa, ancestral land,
With thoughts of a far distant land,
When, where, and in what desert land,
Friends of the sons of every land,
The poet, modest though so grand,
To see you by our fireside stand,
At each extreme one takes his stand,
Wearied of leisure in the end,
And thou, persistent to the end,
My days of life approach their end,
To Love all ages lowly bend,
Are admirable, my dear friend,
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
All to the doctors Eugene send,
Assistance ever will extend,
His mournful heart no peace could find,
Fresh cause of quarrel then I’ll find,
But trembles, words he cannot find,
Of dreary Russia left behind,
Perchance to benefit mankind,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A duellist of classic mind,
Had perished a creative mind,
One image occupied his mind,
But one thought only filled his mind,
A pair; though desolate my mind,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
So uncongenial to my mind,
Of whirligigs were very fond,
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
These to the coach of state are bound,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
The lancer, to his calling bound,
She wore her corset tightly bound,
However cherries might abound,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
A stream, by winter’s ice unbound,
(This by command; for it was found,
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
But, when Onéguine’s turn came round,
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
Congratulations, toasts resound,
The fruits of science, evil, good,
Onéguine meditative stood,
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
A village and beneath, a wood,
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
Her utterances ever heard,
Your conversation cold and hard,
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
Believed, the people’s wisdom weird,
Epistle second, note the third,
To dominate her worthy lord,
Reform me both in deed and word,
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Onéguine wasted; on my word,
No more the music thunders loud,
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
But what a nuisance it will be,
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
As lordly mansions ought to be,
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Or a swift meteor, may be,
Or reconciled them, it may be,
With worldly honours, it may be,
And physic bring with mournful face,
No, ever to behold your face,
No more the village knows his face,
Pallid and melancholy face,
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Drank to her health in the first place,
To follow you in every place,
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
Accelerates her hasty pace,
The easier ’tis to gain her grace,
He called to mind Tattiana’s grace,
A print without the picture’s grace,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
Two poles together glued by ice,
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
But wherefore not?—’Tis pleasant, nice,
Like his, her dress was always nice,
Then they’re so innocent of vice,
Meeting you in times past by chance,
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
God grant that all who herein glance,
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Reviews both dress and countenance,
He yawns, averts his countenance,
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
Then would we muse as in a trance,
The hero’s name too in advance,
And natural benevolence,
To friendship making no pretence,
I, after so much eloquence,
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Our idol, Honour’s motive force,
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
As in a thicket’s humble shade,
Hid in the gondola’s dark shade,
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Was the first question Olga made,
I was for calm existence made,
But sad is the reflection made,
They shovel silver with a spade,
Choosing a profitable trade,
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
She leisurely away doth ride,
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
Suddenly to the left hand side,
And hastened to his uncle’s side,
Tattiana by a poor aunt’s side,
Found them in darkness side by side,
If thou wert sitting by my side,
But now all doubt was set aside,
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
Noblesse and models of the mode,
Of a most mournful episode,
To foreign lands he would allude,
Deep in the distant province rude,
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Before whom once in solitude,
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Virgins miraculous I see,
And a guitar produced we see,
Whither shall he go first? He’ll see,
The break of day she doth not see,
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
Such was Onéguine’s sainted life,
To move in fashionable life,
Who floats contentedly through life,
And like his shadow dogged his life,
Whilst the fond parents, friends thro’ life,
In aimless ease and far from strife,
Without profession, business, wife,
The Muse abandoned, ta’en a wife,
By every proper-minded wife,
But at a later, sterile age,
In boston and the game of age,
As the reflection of his age,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
Or in a squabble to engage,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
Another could her heart engage,
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
No one the contrary will urge,
Unto his own Tattiana he,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
On Sundays by yon window he,
No fond illusions live to soothe,
A dying man with art to soothe,
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Unknown to all, without a tie,
The bridge and alley to the lake,
Her promptings unto law did make,
E’en as the presence of a snake,
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Pedantic although scholar like,
The comrade of your youth should strike,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
She, than the morning moon more pale,
Onéguine’s cheek grew ashy pale,
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
I tried when I began this tale,
Thus in a style obscure and stale,
Fashion is there immutable,
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Regained authority awhile,
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
As rosy lips without a smile,
’Twas built, the venerable pile,
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
Also the works of Fontenelle,
In their sterility of prattle,
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
Careless of every social rule,
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
He wrote (’tis the romantic style,
Her toilette’s antiquated style,
In solid, unpretentious style,
A novel in Lafontaine’s style,
The old Derjavine noticed me,
And, inspiration firing me,
Despair and anger seize on me,
Mournful is thine approach to me,
The door flew open—Olga came,
From Gottingen inspired he came,
And straight returning whence he came,
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
Hateful the hollow world became,
And comfort of each country dame,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
Strange unto her each childish game,
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
You never would have heard the name,
And so Tattiana was her name,
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Descends the bank with care extreme,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
My uncle’s goodness is extreme,
And visit many a foreign clime,
On sunny days the glistening rime,
And thus he spent eight years of time,
It now to investigate is time,
Across her youth a shade had come,
At eventide would hither come,
Yes! for our unpretending home,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
The bard his answer waits at home,
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
“My second!” cried in turn Eugene,
And so departed. But Eugene,
Between myself and my Eugene,
As a poetic life serene,
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
The kennel or a kindred line,
Akulka who was once Celine,
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
Corset and album and Pauline,
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
Bouyànoff, wrathful cousin mine,
Please follow this way, lady mine,
A tombstone, Aphrodite’s shrine,
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
Long tortured by his lay divine,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
About the crop of hay, the wine,
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
That hero, though his merit shone,
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
Forgotten in the village lone,
In horror for itself alone,
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
A constant harping on one tune,
Our dear old aunt, Princess Helène,
Of fashionable dames the foe,
In country solitude you mope,
’Tis said you are a misanthrope,
For a fictitious misanthrope,
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
I ask, all ye who poets are,
His inner consciousness laid bare,
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
I am acquainted with fresh care,
Tattiana’s beauty, pale with care,
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
Lenski at intervals would dare,
I cannot help it I declare,
And impiously should declare,
None could her beautiful declare,
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
But, O ye tomes without compare,
Moscow’s young Graces at her stare,
Tattiana’s love was quite sincere,
With all their progeny were there,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
And yet the city’s flower was there,
If the choice in my power were,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Oblivion of life’s tempest dire,
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Whose tones Apollo’s sons inspire,
All that a poet could desire,
This world. I do not praise desire,
At a great feast against desire,
Slowly exhausted by desire,
His constant soul could ever tire,
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
And brooding o’er the ills he bore,
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
He read as vainly as before,
Thou’lt suffer, dearest, but before,
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
For who imposture can endure,
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
He will delight you, I am sure,
In history he took no pleasure,
Happy who timely grew mature,
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
But Tania’s heart is not at ease,
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
Possession hath no power to please,
To cool the cutlets’ seething grease,
A very troublesome disease,
The curs away to kennel chase,
Not even a poetic phrase,
I say without poetic phrase,
From careless stanzas such as these,
As cyphers others to appraise,
Tired by the ball’s incessant noise,
Could in a humble sphere despise,
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
Late in the afternoon to rise,
Miraculously fair arise,
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
With his exasperated sense,
May be the empire of the sense,
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Though now my love might be intense,
Ladies in crowds around her close,
Malignant fury they disclose,
But nowhere can she find repose,
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
(Readers expect the rhyme of rose,
And the conviction soon arose,
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
As many dinners I rehearse,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Too much I’m given to intersperse,
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
In age the memory gets worse,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Existence would not make a curse,
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
But I the products of my Muse,
The thirst for fame and man’s applause,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Now, as in a deserted house,
Then became busy with the house,
“What can be drearier than the house,
Received him freely at her house,
Night separated from her spouse,
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
To my old nurse alone peruse,
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
The Lovelaces are out of date,
All this I know is out of date,
Indifferent and sedate,
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
He nears a spacious mansion’s gate,
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
“Your fashionable world I hate,
With her they did associate,
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
But if the truth I must relate,
But now my mind is desolate,
A mild quotation to translate,
And you, O maids immaculate,
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Conscious of death approximate,
And, joy of souls effeminate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
I had found my predestinate,
He marmot-like did hibernate,
If but to lighten Time’s dull rate,
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
The Làrinas would celebrate,
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Her manners were deliberate,
His double sashes and his grate,
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
With jealous fire resuscitate,
Perchance some heart ’twill agitate,
The matter did not agitate,
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Encountered punishment complete,
Who the romance do not complete,
With unanimity complete,
In bud of promise incomplete,
The weary way still incomplete,
The fervid poet would recite,
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
Winter resigned her empire white,
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
The converse of the world polite,
Nor even tears afford respite,
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
A Russian household simple quite,
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
On innocent delights I dote,
On balls I madly used to dote,
’Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
She heard of servant-maids the note,
So let us to the ball-room haste,
All which in Paris eager taste,
And education runs to waste,
In the beginning, cold and mute,
None could a trace of that impute,
With this unpleasant tête-à-tête,
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
Latin is just now not in vogue,
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
Thou also, my ideal true,
’Tis time to marry her, ’tis true,
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
Was it not so?—for thee I gave,
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
But promise of our meeting gave,
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
A first success light pinions gave,
The prejudices all men have,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
The fatal secrets of the grave,
For him an honourable grave,
To mention the foregoing eve,
Shrill sang the samovar at eve,
To jest as he had done last eve,
Not the young timid maid, believe,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
To me he would his Olga give,
Time without me will lessons give,
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
To swagger as the art of love,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
By absence who hath chilled his love,
I love you with a brother’s love,
My spirit and my blood doth move,
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
If Olga smilingly approve,
Polite demeanour to preserve,
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
Him who inspired both love and awe,
To arm the tongue and e’en the eye,
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
To raise his pistol to his eye,
I’ve scanned it with a jealous eye,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
On everything around her gaze,
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
“But,” cried Zaretski in amaze,
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Let not the poet’s spirit freeze,
Him a disquietude did seize,
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
Is ever ready with relief,
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
The family of Kharlikoff,
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
Page after page continued reading,
However, Tania’s letter reading,
But she, her sister never heeding,
Espy him approaching,
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
I guard it as a holy thing,
Shone pungent Satire’s dauntless king,
Or, parable more flattering,
To our Tattiana conquering,
Upon the meadows showering,
Some other long-departed Spring,
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Behold! orthography despising,
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
At last my father gave his blessing,
Attentive to the heart’s first beating,
Wafted upon poetic wing,
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
Of pictures painful harrowing,
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Glittered in a perspective long,
She gazed—a cue, forgotten long,
The nightingale there all night long,
Existence calmly sped along,
“Nothing, good nurse, there’s nothing wrong,
Either with him or thee in song,
Happy he who in youth was young,
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
The words bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Attentive listened to his speech,
Nor the Journal des Modes, I vouch,
’Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
My doom has been pronounced on high,
Sails her allotted course on high,
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
When separation’s hour drew nigh,
But finally she heaves a sigh,
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
In scenes like these it may be though,
His breast was riddled through and through,
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
He lies, upon his forehead death,
“Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
Impatient, boiling o’er with wrath,
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Without the ken of parents both,
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
“Drive on!” the cheerful cry goes forth,
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
For him were but of little worth,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
To the impressions of our youth,
Found the ideal of my youth,
But, knowing not the actual truth,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
To listen to the words you speak,
Vows matrimonial to break,
A Russian in Childe Harold’s cloak,
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
He loved the simpleton to mock,
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
At times, if only once a week,
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
And then a cup of coffee drank,
An oval countenance and pink,
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Vladimir closes up his book,
Into accounts would sometimes look,
How bright and tender was his look,
To flight before her radiant look,
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
’Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
An honourable course ye took,
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
’Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
They deem her somewhat finical,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
And female tears hysterical,
Economy political,
And cannot anything conceal,
Of untold gain she must conceal,
When the mazurka used to peal,
Outlandish and provincial,
A ball in Peter’s capital,
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
The sharp incisions of his nail,
Within its wave the sounding pail,
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Indifferent he became to all,
The snow descends and buries all,
Her sentimental verses all,
The twilight pale which softens all,
’Tis now the season! Idlers all,
To slay himself with blade or ball,
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
So, when he came next day to call,
A whisper runs along the hall,
Crush and confusion in the hall,
I envied sore the billows tall,
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Hung like a print against the wall,
Shouts, laughter, jamming ’gainst the wall,
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
“How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
At thirty who was married well,
And think: here lies who loved me well,
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
Your heart possesses, I know well,
I have no leisure here to dwell,
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
At twenty who was prig or swell,
My unpretending page shall fill,
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Let us proceed unto a rill,
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
Domestic life attracts me still,
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
To wander through the meadows still,
An hour passed by—another—till,
“Monsieur l’Abbé” a starving Gaul,
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
And now philanthropy his soul,
Now don’t be cross with me, my soul,
Of your perfections in my soul,
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
The memory of the bard, a dream,
Eugene at first began to dream,
To the fair object of his dream,
The story of his young love’s dream,
I will descant on love’s sweet dream,
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
E’en from her cradle’s earliest dream,
All this may be an empty dream,
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Thou’lt quaff love’s sweet envenomed stream,
Thinking to float upon the stream,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
A wish from place to place to roam,
But, as he never opened them,
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
Of what not, and of distant dim,
Dared calmly cleanse his nails ’fore him,
He sang of separation grim,
A country damsel’s album trim,
Thus age approached, the common doom,
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
Her health, life’s sweetness and its bloom,
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
And leans upon the monster’s arm,
The amatory science warm,
In thy imagination warm,
He “Benedetta” used to hum,
Dressing as quickly as he can,
’Twas plain—an oaken floor ye scan,
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
Zaretski, village mechanician,
I’ve thought well o’er the general plan,
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Let me present ye to the man,
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
He was an honest gentleman,
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
In her friends’ albums, time had been,
The butt of scandal having been,
Repose from labour, satire keen,
In springtime on the meadows green,
To this arrangement can be seen,
But nothing changed in them is seen,
The torment born of crime unseen,
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
“Onéguine, I was younger then,
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Having abjured the haunts of men,
And isolated from all men,
So inaccessible to men,
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Nor precepts sage nor pictures e’en,
An exile from their troublous reign,
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
How bitterly he would malign,
Dreading the world’s remarks malign,
Landscapes thereon he would design,
My heart’s allegiance can resign,
My gratitude do not disdain,
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
Onéguine, bored to death again,
Or if he meant to flirt again,
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
As deaf and silly doth remain,
He obstinately will remain,
But, that life longer may remain,
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
The bard’s enthusiastic strain,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
My light productions to retain,
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
And distance interposed in vain,
I’ve wasted in amusements vain,
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
The converse of our hermits twain,
In solitude or worldly din,
Ere conversation could begin,
The pall of night was growing thin,
Still everywhere, without, within,
He heard his soul’s complaint within,
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
A canine face with horns thereon,
And that unrivalled paragon,
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
The torrent of opinion,
The natural fickleness of passion,
Shall abdicate the bard’s profession,
Although it will not bear translation,
A coquette loves by calculation,
And hot with jealous indignation,
Original imagination,
Triumphant by anticipation,
The fair of the next generation,
And thou, youth’s early inspiration,
Not knowing its interpretation,
A Vampire fond of meditation,
An innate love of meditation,
And buried deep in meditation,
And marking Tania’s agitation,
Which is he? or an imitation,
A love which knew no limitation,
Amid a serious disputation,
Seeing in this no deprivation,
To the sarcastic observation,
And a determined disposition,
Was worthy of that old baboon,
And bends her mirror on the moon,
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
Submissive as if in a swoon,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
The counsel good and full of reason,
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
He eyed her with a fond concern,
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
Perchance you also soon may burn,
My wretched Lenski’s fate I mourn,
To visit, lovely maid, return,
To freeze his finger hath begun,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
This northern summer of our own,
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
The aged nurse in ample gown,
But, to his uncle’s mansion flown,
For summer to the country flown,
Fresh aspirations I have known,
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
For o’er a word to fashion known,
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
And the young damsel from the town,
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
And so my noon hath come! If so,
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Which o’er the waters boldly leap,
Or at a promenade mayhap,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
Buried in meditation deep,
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
Where is Onéguine? Half asleep,
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
The sun had mounted high his steep,
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Like down from Aeolus’s lip,
All are constrained and fetters bear,
Not only sorrow—Ah! my dear,
Or e’en Istomina, my dear,
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
A friar black approaching near,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
A lady draws the hostess near,
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
Unknown to all he doth appear,
Go, on the Neva’s bank appear,
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
O’er my remains to drop a tear,
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
Malek Adel and De Linar,
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
As in the timid forest deer,
Gliding in negligent career,
Romance of love I pray refer,
“Well!”—“I the elder should prefer,
To Eve the universal mother,
Servant of God and brigadier,
Where dwelt the Muses’ worshipper,
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
His bit with foam besprinkled o’er,
So ancient warriors, battles o’er,
But with confused and bashful air,
Lo! my Onéguine free as air,
Is occupied with Olga fair,
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
Is it not true? the objects fair,
Describe in detail the affair,
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
And the Skatènines, aged pair,
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
The freshness of her heart impair,
Flies past the porter to the stair,
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
And Fliànoff, pensioned councillor,
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
Comfort and succour to the poor,
And wheresoe’er thy footsteps err,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
Impressionable for an hour,
With purple hand Aurora leads,
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
That crass stupidity misleads,
She the delicious novel reads,
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
“Then come with me.” The prince proceeds,
Professions eagerly for deeds,
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Where each young critic ready stands,
At times my reason almost bends,
The avalanche of snow first bends,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
No one my anguish comprehends,
Against my inclination, friends,
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
Existence without wife or friends,
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
On us beyond the grave attends,
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Scarce to her questions he responds,
Of passion reminiscences,
’Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
The remnant destiny concedes,
“Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
And supercilious dames she glides,
A crab upon a spider rides,
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
And all thy precious elegies,
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
From hall to yard and garden flies,
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
What more’s required? The world replies,
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
Some a mazurka occupies,
Past palaces and nunneries,
In the world’s mortal revelries,
And pelt him with cherries,
To watch with lovers’ ecstasies,
From public and from private ties,
Than cold Onéguine’s oddities,
I yield for splendid vanities,
The gilding of life’s vanities,
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
He now a full possession takes,
May be, and this my terror wakes,
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
Also, to equalise the scales,
She got a book of nursery tales,
The coach is borne o’er ruts and holes,
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Upon her elbow she reclines,
The golden ember now enshrines,
And fashionable magazines,
And now he views forgotten foes,
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Now, like hereditary foes,
And meditative homeward goes,
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
The accents wild of other’s woes,
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
Imagination’s sacred fires,
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
And where tempestuous love’s desires,
And of the irksome harness tires,
Which in your spirit dominates,
But wretched who anticipates,
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
And what like menaces fatigues,
All which caprice and affluence craves,
Across the Baltic’s salt sea waves,
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
She the acquaintances she loves,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
And various chords upon it proves,
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
The peasants there are rich as kings,
But still remembrance to him clings,
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
Obedient to the magic strings,
Along the Neva’s bank he sleighs,
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Exceptionless as no rule is,
I just hint, in parenthesis,
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
The old man who has had his freaks,
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
Diana’s bosom, Flora’s cheeks,
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
But now—my very blood congeals,
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Impelled by Spring’s dissolving beams,
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
For rural solitude and dreams,
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
And heedless of approval seems,
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
When evening o’er the landscape looms,
Disport yourselves, maidens,
Young maidens, fair maidens,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
To secrets of virgins,
Friends and companions,
Barking, young ladies’ osculations,
And dames of fine organisations,
Latest arrivals’ salutations,
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
Had finished life amid his sons,
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
With flame more ardent passion burns,
All covered up with snow in heaps,
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Without participation hears,
Although the destined coffin nears,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
All in the good old style appears,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
(So ’twas with us in former years,
For dolls, e’en from her earliest years,
The solstice of our earthly years,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Onéguine, O my gentle readers,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Old age through spectacles too peers,
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Epicurean philosophers,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Youth freshens beneath Passion’s showers,
Of Levshin’s school ye followers,
Develops and matures its powers,
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
He to the festival repairs,
’Tis day, the family downstairs,
A moment effervescing stirs,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
Balconies, lion’s heads on doors,
And hated casual visitors,
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
Judge then what roses would be ours,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And lo! five paces more they pass,
Yet satiated with success,
In the world’s vortex my success,
But the indifferent princess,
And now, I mournfully confess,
Her heart how full of gentleness,
In melancholy loveliness,
Oppressive now is happiness,
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
“Onéguine, all this sumptuousness,
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Conquer by passion and address,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
A young Armida’s lips to press,
She hears the bear behind her press,
She starts, nor doth a word express,
Hymen’s embarrassments, distress,
Love’s tender transports and distress,
And though I read it with distress,
Tattiana’s letter I possess,
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
As every journal now entreats,
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
Leaning against the dam expects,
Their coming which no man expects,
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Along Saint Petersburg’s paved streets,
Though without palaces and streets,
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
And oh! what verses, what delights,
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
With rapturous longing he awaits,
Will teach grammatical conceits,
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
With cherries, red currants,
Its splendour and its blandishments,
But, after mutual compliments,
The hours once more Onéguine counts,
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
Variety of speech and vests,
Corneille’s majestic genius,
A critic of the stage malicious,
A slave of actresses capricious,
There Didelot became glorious,
She seemed of him oblivious,
By such allusions scandalous,
By Tolstoy’s pencil marvellous,
With satisfaction marvellous,
Thou also, reader generous,
Then ye were barely generous,
Abandon cities riotous,
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
To male acquaintances he bows,
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
And this the faithful one allows,
Upon the dreary northern snows,
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
As partner of my mournful days,
O triumphs of my guileless days,
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
No more with pale Diana’s rays,
Till the mazurka’s close he stays,
But soon she altered all her ways,
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
The household troop of little boys,
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
And boiling o’er with friendly heat,
The passionate speeches I’ll repeat,
Which lessons unto us repeat,
A hundred times will not repeat,
Alone amid possessions great,
A ball here, there a children’s treat,
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
When in the study’s calm retreat,
Abandoned he his country seat,
Removed her to his country seat,
Begins to talk of this and that,
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Upon my lake I love to float,
But when two minutes she had sat,
My friend, ’tis but to pay a debt,
Should make me much more circumspect,
And Christian folk will, I expect,
Such am I. This did ye expect,
So full of piety, correct,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
The miserable bard to meet,
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Her with a smile old women greet,
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
Beside a nameless rivulet,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Where in the country Eugene yet,
’Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
“Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Forth the kibitka gallops swift,
And by the world repeated oft,
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
China and bronze the tables weight,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
To many a noisy feast and fight,
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
The ladies’ dresses airy, light,
The crowd and merriment and light,
Blest be the labours of the light,
There came a sudden flash of light,
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Arising with the morning’s light,
The firmament in mellow light,
Was younger than myself, my light,
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
Our hero stops and doth alight,
E’en for an instant find delight,
Abandoning insane delight,
To find in gossip such delight,
A sense of social delight,
And solitude and calm delight,
Contemplativeness, her delight,
My pen no longer finds delight,
I love its furious delight,
And full of innocent delight,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Having remarked Vladimir’s flight,
His care unto his pistols’ plight,
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
But turning morning into night,
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
Seductive, animated, bright,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
The motley moving mass and bright,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
In winter on the fender bright,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
O’erspread with Winter’s carpet bright,
To youthful Olga’s beauty bright,
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
A register of fleeting thought,
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Eugene of course related nought,
The languid mind could smile at nought,
In Tania’s praise in pouch he brought,
A table to the fire is brought,
Again her rural life she sought,
From storms protection having sought,
The “in memoriam” pages sought,
All Nature winter seemed to await,
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
On winters of the south a skit,
The table with its lamp unlit,
Onéguine could not now submit,
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
As we lure the young gallant,
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
And o’er the granite coping bent,
The needle nor, o’er framework bent,
His butting horns in anger bent,
Of affectation innocent,
Because she was so innocent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Haughty appear, subservient,
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
True friend, landlord benevolent,
I’ll pass beneath the firmament,
And pleasure’s daily blandishment,
To what malicious merriment,
Calm and without embarrassment,
With epigrams impertinent,
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Since leisure was together spent,
A while ago the winter spent,
Being from hell or heaven sent,
To a surrender gave consent,
And with his lot in life content,
But was our friend Eugene content,
Into the lonely house she went,
The Làrinas unwisely went,
The poor girl fell into a faint,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
And in the final tome we learnt,
To labour in his sledge forgot,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Then, the far capital forgot,
Philanthropist or patriot,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
Was a delightful little spot,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Thee but a little space bewept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
Because her passion wanted art,
But followed the strict rules of art,
How soon he learnt deception’s art,
Sometimes by pleasing flattery’s art,
Wherein I felt love’s fatal dart,
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
And the lone secret of her heart,
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
A hidden meaning could impart,
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Her passion’s faithful counterpart,
Which from the devil’s bookcase start,
His own antagonists expert,
As oft to meat and drink advert,
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
And no ridiculous report,
At times to silence would resort,
With pungent or obtuse retort,
Vociferously paid her court,
But, howsoe’er his lot were cast,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
That youthful heart—“But, now at least,
He was beloved: or say at least,
Bard of the “Feasts,” and mournful breast,
She hid the trouble of her breast,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
Which rankled in Tattiana’s breast,
Poetical enthusiast,
She found herself alone at last,
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Appeared, Don’s effervescing boast,
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
The laws of generations past,
Or, after dinner’s dull repast,
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
The gulf between them was so vast,
In Russ her love made manifest,
To treat the matter as a jest,
And is it true and not a jest,
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
The credulous indeed are blest,
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
The body they consigned to rest,
His weary head declined at rest,
A beauty languidly at rest,
Ye feel but little interest,
Having once fixed your interest,
And then made merry pope and guest,
Unto the sounding sea to list,
From apprehension of the cost,
Romances pleased her from the first,
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
To light had brought them from their dust,
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
All the young people round about,
At forty suffered from the gout,
A little Juvenal to spout,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
His comedies, a noisy rout,
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
To the young girl he said adieu,
Obedient then to Nature’s law,
A young man motionless he saw,
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
The woods, still naked to the view,
I still a complication view,
She never more his face may view,
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
As in a garden when I grew,
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
To look on life as on a show,
What languor would his silence show,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
They are all natural and low,
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
A feeble version read below,
With its exhilarating flow,
From happy inspiration flow,
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
But such is not my project now,
Then they came easily enow,
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
Nought but of dinners a long row,
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
The horizon luminous doth grow,
The Muse capricious let us coax,
In love, although its tempests vex,
We visit about Christmas Day,
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
And past the threshold of decay,
Unto their solitude one day,
Impatient waits the close of day,
To anticipate the break of day,
To-morrow before break of day,
He sat, and then the livelong day,
Had much to do at home that day,
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Till morn—life uniform but gay,
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
Within his memory there lay,
In the beginning of this lay,
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Who, heard the music of my lay,
And for a time our course delay,
Then, her distraction to allay,
How with thy medal I would play,
A game of chess would often play,
Or by a card our homage pay,
“To-morrow’s dawn will glimmer gray,
Avowal then ’twas time to pray,
Here bottles stand in close array,
Behind, of glasses an array,
But I abandoned their array,
The trees in silvery array,
All with urbanity betray,
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
He cared no longer there to stay,
There jars of cider block the way,
In a lax or informal way,
Unto the fields she makes her way,
“Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
Nor did her blushes fade away,
The starry beacons fade away,
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
I write, and anguish flies away,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
The lily’s stem to eat away,
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
Ivan Petròvitch still a gaby,
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
Tania, observed by nobody,
A lover’s letter might convey,
He ne’er shall hear Time’s eulogy,
I cannot tell the reason why,
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
Presents her quarto amiably,
But Eugene, incontestably,
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
And turned to leave immediately,
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
And the world met her smilingly,
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
But of this love, e’en casually,
By waters shining tranquilly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
His transports were quite maidenly,
Though I’ll return to him right early,
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
From habit or maliciously,
Like Venus when, capriciously,
In the French language perfectly,
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
Employ your glasses constantly,
And of the attic. Honestly,
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Having performed his service truly,
There, in that knot of company,
The man and liked his company,
I thank thee. In thy company,
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
Hath whiled the road’s monotony,
It occupied him from a boy,
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
Sang childhood’s pastimes and its joy,
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Light sallies without coxcombry,
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Upon the windows tracery,
By night prepared for sorcery,
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
But, her own room in memory,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
That Nina’s marble symmetry,
Fragments of northern poetry,
And platitudes and pedantry,
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Carried away by ecstasy,
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
Lead into good society,
Lest jaded with satiety,
Upon its damp opacity,
Cursing his own stupidity,
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
Discovered much absurdity,
By dull insensibility,
Like him renouncing vanity,
Of old maids the divinity,
Passed into dull eternity,
Charming is your sincerity,
As Winter in their purity,
Dreams with no continuity,
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
With hope and then perplexity,
I thought—retirement, liberty,
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Idolatry of liberty,
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
Then dressed himself...
The mystic monogram, O. E.
My word of honour given have I.
At last the author!” cries Mamma.
Verses and tears et cetera.
Bouyànoff whisked off Poustiakova.
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
And triumphs in career erotic.
Above the ashes of the dead.
Some are afar and some are dead.
To seek him out with bended head.
And soon Lel hovered o’er her head.
All silently hung down his head.
And lessons to his children read.
No other book had time to read.
But word for word his letter read.
That certain volumes she might read.
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
For the impatient chief instead.
Attentive listened to the lad.
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
He long should have been on the road.
In love-lorn meditation sad.
I was incensed and he was sad.
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
She could not sleep in her new bed.
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
The friends are called and quickly placed.
And exclamations interlaced.
In what he merely acquiesced.
To all good neighbours’ sport conduced.
All overtures of friendship ended.
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
’Tis done. To supper they proceed.
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
Mortally sick I am indeed.
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
Was with himself dissatisfied.
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
And a new diadem supplied.
By other thoughts be occupied.
Longtime her mind is occupied.
And not a speck of dirt descried.
And a long time about her talked.
I cannot longer wage concealed.
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
“What ails thee?”—“Nothing.”—He is fled.
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
As if with eider-down is filled.
And in her conversation drawled.
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
Feeling in others much esteemed.
He thought so, and existence charmed.
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Inseparable they remained.
Before he eighteen years attained.
With us is easily attained.
I’m not for witchcraft now inclined.
Certain misfortune near opined.
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
He on the conflagration frowned.
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
A countenance perplexed and scared.
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
For evermore had disappeared.
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
And harmony was soon restored.
I long enough deceived have erred.
And what she from the cards inferred.
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
Till proper rings could be procured.
To her an elegy composed.
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
“What ails thee, dear?”—“I feel depressed.
Are not with elegance impressed.
The image of her seal impressed.
So she in French herself expressed.
Not agony, but death expressed.
The room my former master used.
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
Bouyànoff courted. She refused.
A book at early morn perused.
Were to analysis subjected.
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
Which afterwards the muse revived.
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Without the least constraint he bowed.
In correspondence been allowed.
And necessary fools allowed.
Titles and ages intermixed.
At prisoner’s base she never played.
The drama of my youth was played.
In Olga’s face no life’s displayed.
Attend in male attire arrayed.
Their giddy sports she ne’er enjoyed.
And “Agathon” replied, amazed.
And her upon the threshold laid.
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
A load of care upon the maid.
Remained with him the youthful maid.
For shame lift up the modest maid.
A due which must to earth be paid.
Nor frigid adulation paid.
Fortune the poet had repaid.
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
In mist profound all yet is hid.
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
An almanac but eight years old.
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
But cannot stand the northern cold.
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
His mother from the door doth scold.
The medium is required of gold.
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
No one appeared to lend a hand.
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Her foot was in my other hand.
A loaded pistol in his hand.
The ruts of his own fatherland.
November at the gate did stand.
Charms more enduring in the end.
To thy decree my will I bend.
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
And they the waters recommend.
Into the starry night extend.
But finally in wedlock bind.
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
Of all the guests within his mind.
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
And stoves of various shapes abound.
And secretly their views expound.
Of horn in circle call them round.
And devastate the woods around.
A tangled wilderness around.
And flooded all the level ground.
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
At this time almost understood.
The river through the linden wood.
A noted fop who gambled hard.
A young and handsome galliard.
The company deep silence guard.
She deemed its outline might afford.
Of my light paramour was proud.
Even as Moscow, city proud.
Or recognized not in the crowd.
And long perukes hath vanishèd.
Will to the old times faithful be.
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Inseparable soon they be.
Ne’er trusted to the treacherous ace.
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
The damsel under escort place.
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
By “belle Tattiana” to replace.
Inheritor of all his race.
The boy was wild but full of grace.
Then handed her the song with grace.
For there he left a mournful trace.
Of the commencement of the piece.
In mother Winter’s strange caprice.
And shall adopt some new caprice.
Before him her wild game of chance.
Upon the stage his weary glance.
And in her hand a French romance.
Canto the First of this romance.
Such open-hearted innocence.
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
Habit would bring indifference.
His energy and impotence.
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And yet oblivion forbade.
Though late, have a beginning made.
But no reply unto her made.
Nor further comment that night made.
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
His fate shall presently decide.
Meet punishment for him provide.
Onéguine oped the cupboards wide.
Upon my visions such intrude.
Daily of love in solitude.
Measured with great exactitude.
From such digressions wholly free.
Perchance he will to all the three.
His valet brings him letters three.
“Olinka is her junior, see.
Know that thy face that day I see.
The giddy world at last shall see.
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
He knew not how to spend his life.
And rest from bygone days of strife.
Of error and the passions’ strife.
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Or better,—like a faithful wife.
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
The family of children hie.
There’ll be a fight. I do not lie.
Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie.
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
I the same admonition make.
Acquaintance instantly to make.
“’Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
The ladies’ laughter to provoke.
Tattiana terrified awoke.
Already sings the nightingale.
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
I know there’s none more amiable.
Honour and pride inflexible.
Singing in chorus all the while.
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
I owe the censorship a little.
Avenge himself in proper style.
To sketch ye in Albano’s style.
His character attracted me.
And fled afar—she followed me.
You will not all abandon me.
That first the Muse appeared to me.
Will he pursue?—But no one came.
Because a member I became.
But turn we once more to our dame.
Trembles at artificial shame.
He kindled his poetic flame.
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
By love’s inevitable flame.
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Another passed; ’twas just the same.
The olden time shall be my theme.
Of touching lightly every theme.
Transported to our Russian clime.
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
For a protracted space of time.
And may fall headlong any time.
Announcing to him dinner-time.
In winter time would often come.
Triumphant with the answer come.
And shorter had the days become.
A shape half cat and half a crane.
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
Of the domains of the side-scene.
Such were the musings of Eugene.
All this was novel to Eugene.
“And is it,” meditates Eugene.
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
’Tis Heaven’s will and I am thine.
Diminishes as years decline.
Do all things which to mirth incline.
No other than Onéguine mine.
Well known unto Onéguine mine.
Of my impassioned heroine.
To pass the night at home hath gone.
The ball in all its splendour shone.
“Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Can hearty welcome give alone.
“Mine!” cried Eugene with savage tone.
That all may hear his voice’s tone.
No answer all that day was borne.
Or quietly partake our woe.
E’en hopeless egoism’s dark shape.
With taffety instead of crape.
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here.
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
Tattiana gently led them there.
And be not in advance severe.
I yield the fruit of work severe.
Olga with trepidation dire.
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
And that no longer could inspire.
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
A hidden train of wild desire.
Which glowed with virginal desire.
The wit of others to acquire.
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Whom thirty centuries adore.
My spirit with such pangs before.
They stir the heart as heretofore.
Of the imperial Neva’s shore.
The captives of the Salguir’s shore.
Or by the ocean’s rocky shore.
And thy protection I implore.
Society renounced once more.
With affectation,—nothing more.
And homeward like an arrow tore.
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
Of modern Russians the disease.
In motley and amusing chase.
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Eugene would speak regarding these.
Of passion they so often raise.
The curtain now they slowly raise.
To God eternal hymns of praise.
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
And would by candlelight arise.
He is a charming youth and wise.
Pervaded with much common sense.
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Do agitate his late repose.
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Round which revolves the universe.
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Now I am ready to refuse.
The drum already doth arouse.
But Olga would not such peruse.
They long ago had held debate.
The story of thy life and fate.
Indifferent was her future fate.
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
And jests doth recapitulate.
Of life or death predestinate.
Perchance one more affectionate.
For evermore is separate.
If cleverly or not I prate.
By rank as settled by the State.
The sorrows of a single state.
My heart of old would captivate.
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
The girl in marriage they unite.
I have endured without respite.
Beyond this may attempt to write.
Serve who could neither read nor write.
And irritates the appetite.
And town and friends forgotten quite.
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Or the delivery of a note.
Interrogation to denote.
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
And an elegiac poem wrote.
And the attendants called in haste.
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
More satisfaction to her taste.
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
For ever your Tattiana leave.
And all without her husband’s leave.
Alarm the winter journey gave.
He sang of love—to love a slave.
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
My guardian angel to the grave.
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
In clouds of steam above perceive.
To write in cantos twenty-five.
Us from the world wherein we live.
Mutual destruction to contrive.
Applause, the people’s donative.
I can’t translate the adjective.
Extended—haunt which Dryads love.
And in the Summer Garden rove.
Around the meadow and the grove.
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
To strike imagination serve.
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
The cynosure of every eye.
The hero we immortalize.
Love’s pangs Tattiana agonize.
Having lost all in life we prize.
Our union would produce but grief.
With deeper woe than others’ grief.
Than one’s own fascinating self.
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
I’m o’er it ever pondering.
Ceased for a space all chattering.
That I forget not whom I sing.
To happiness contributing.
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
A riding whip. She strolls along.
She brought with her the gift of song.
With dance and with song.
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Or letters of a maiden young.
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
To-day it is my turn to teach.
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Alas! with merited reproach.
But ultimately doth approach.
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
With gay design and silken stitch.
Above the humble urn of death.
Affectionately yours till death.
And what the old man might bequeath.
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
By the fine silver of the north.
My frivolous and jolly youth.
Openly or ’neath decent cloak.
And thus secures the prey we seek.
He’s a freemason, so we think.
And shut him in a lonely nook.
His course unto the running brook.
To ask her name the trouble took.
The sad moon only could remark.
Already he grew phthisical.
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
A fop, in dress pedantical.
The path which leads to glory’s goal.
The eyes of a grave general.
Behind her a grave general.
In one thing really did excel.
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
To such—delightful to repel.
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Until her powers of running fail.
With eye precise and without fail.
A true account and in detail.
For long he had endured them all.
They shout and no one lists at all.
Was not surprised thereby at all.
He knits his brows—’tis silent all.
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
How thy hands burn!”—“Dear nurse, I’m well.
His relative and friend as well.
And wished to say to him farewell.
And wisely gallops to the hill.
To listen to the rippling rill.
A garden by a shining rill.
The coach before a house stood still.
To stay the maid against her will.
As in their turn the seasons roll.
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
Learn to possess more self-control.
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
Enchanted by the moon’s pale beam.
And a boy handed round the cream.
Guards fondly hope’s uncertain dream.
Perish absorbed by Lethe’s stream.
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
Back to his regiment must roam.
Torquato Tasso’s strains I deem.
’Tis something of this sort I deem.
With such a perversity proclaim.
Where the first time she met with him.
From first to last page to the rim.
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
In some a willing martyrdom.
Pétòushkoff met the selfsame doom.
This is my master’s sitting-room.
Distinctly not its mechanism.
A new acquaintance we must scan.
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
At last became a ruined man.
A fond and careful mother been.
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
As your light footprints on the green.
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Yawning betook him to a pen.
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
By sympathy I have been driven.
And satisfied with vengeance ta’en.
Away, Tattiana, hath been ta’en.
To crush me with a just disdain.
Listen to me without disdain.
Should dearly like a dance again.
It wakens in my breast again.
By an avowal just as plain.
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Would she in silence long remain.
The dream left terror in its train.
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
Or e’en the “Demon” of my strain.
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
Pair after pair the race sustain.
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
He reads at random, reads in vain.
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
“Here, he resides with Simeon.
The youthful poet’s fond confession.
Tattiana was her appellation.
Of such a dread hallucination.
Introduce verse in conversation.
A charm with it in conversation.
As formerly much agitation.
Rescue me from oblivion.
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
His spirit was intent upon.
To visit Moscow in the season.
The works of Mr. Richardson.
Was certainly no Grandison.
He seemed for matrimony born.
Which ’neath her pillow lay till morn.
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Have entered never to return.
Across the smiling face of dawn.
Far from his Italy—his own.
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
And at the table sat her down.
You never since your nose have shown.
Thus her perversity hath shown.
The opportunity is flown.
And bitter torment never known.
“Ideal,” he had drowsy grown.
Slept o’er the river misty grown.
“To—?”—“Làrina.”—“Tattiana?”—“So.
They hand in hand to table go.
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Whither that evening he will go.
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
Which we experienced long ago.
Familiar to him long ago.
My beauty, thou art ready too.
But would not look at Cicero.
Or a professor in tulle cap.
And all in snow is buried deep.
But stares into the darkness deep.
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
The sudden rattling of a car.
Will sound an insult in your ear.
And breathe a drama in his ear.
To the assembly her they bear.
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Even as the love of children dear.
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
She will not see, she will not hear.
With sad refrain misfortune near.
Do me a favour and appear.
Would at the proper time appear.
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
And happy unto you appear.
In the dawn of existence drear.
The aspect of a landscape drear.
The coming of life’s Autumn drear.
Old women at the coachmen swear.
For us, may be for many a year.
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
And exclamations and good cheer.
Amid the company career.
Girls the kashourka much prefer.
And like a shadow haunted her.
Unfavourable unto her.
He leisurely adorns for her.
But finally grew bored by her.
Recent instructions of its mother.
Malicious and a slanderer.
This was his social character.
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o’er.
And vanish like a bird in air.
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
The gossip of their ladies fair.
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
He knows Kaverine will repair.
Yet still remains the old despair.
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
She peeped through a chink of the door.
Olga ran skipping from the door.
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
Opens unto her visitor.
In this case quite mistaken was.
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
And a grand festival proceeds.
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
And gradually day unfolds.
His son and mortgages his lands.
Obedient to warm Spring’s commands.
And care but little for its ends.
Then glittering in the sun descends.
The feet of my dear lady friends.
Tattiana motionless abides.
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
Around the garden homeward hies.
A sportsman who in covert lies.
Slumber still o’er him lingering flies.
Look through the window and kill flies.
All breathless and without replies.
And the bad book accompanies.
The general who accompanies.
He roars, and “Ah!” Tattiana cries.
With raspberries, cherries.
To peer into the future tries.
At neighbouring hospitalities.
Spared him not their asperities.
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
Without grammatical mistakes.
His recent glory he invokes.
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
And due precautions take betimes.
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
Wherein love innocently pines.
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
All arise. To the door he goes.
All vanished as an echo goes.
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
As with innumerable fires.
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
Jackdaws on every spire—in scores.
Which shines with iridescent hues.
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
Goddess of lovers’ tender sighs.
For the first time the hammer clicks.
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
And beckon to the passing sails.
Custom the despot soon prevails.
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
And the heart’s agitated dreams.
To agitate me in my dreams.
And more imagination teems.
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
The frolics of maidens.
The secrets of maidens.
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
Her heart importunately turns.
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
’Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
A little virgin mirror peeps.
She calm and unconcerned appears.
With his ferocious mate appears.
And to these letters and these tears.
Have shone as one of fashion’s leaders.
She ne’er repeated unto hers.
By bee and butterfly which pass.
There was no angling for success.
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Men become friends from idleness.
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
And freezing fits of weariness.
All sons of mental weariness.
In rhyming I show laziness.
Aroused in him some tenderness.
The bays of age and helplessness.
Await the long-delayed caress.
To array himself in evening dress.
Or kiss the border of her dress.
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Beneath his lips’ devouring kiss.
A lady’s hand doth never kiss.
This evanescent boyish bliss.
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
And stay whose length none recollects.
In the meantime the mill inspects.
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
And his poor basten sandal knits.
The epistle from the bard presents.
The stomach doth admonish us.
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
With all dissatisfaction shows.
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
And all the joys which Winter knows.
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
On unknown female forms he throws.
O’er hillock and o’er meadow throws.
To vary for a few brief days.
The very morning of our days.
Companion of my childhood’s days.
Or Bogdanovitch’s sweet lays.
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
Nor interest in aught betrays.
And hates the world’s discordant ways.
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
And blush to own himself reflect.
An inn at every stage erect.
Of the Æneid, but incorrect.
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Young ladies’ faces and their feet.
Are oft deceptive—like their feet.
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
And watch her eye’s full glance to meet.
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Where God alone knows whom she met.
Of one thing till again we met.
Ere the bright messenger had set.
A simple tombstone hath been set.
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
And hurried home his awful freight.
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
By liberties or loose or light.
Could not eclipse her neighbour’s light.
“But death from him will be delight.
The curse of commonplace delight.
His spirit sank with strange delight.
And bless mankind with full delight.
His ardent soul with full delight.
And solitude and calm delight.
And Schiller read by candlelight.
And swifter than the swallow’s flight.
And be as happy—as I might.
And blest the shadows of the night.
Outside descend the mists of night.
From her half-open vest of night.
The altar flame was quenched in night.
“Delighted.”—“When?”—“This very night.
So there will be a dance to-night.
Paris and Menelaus right.
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
I was half silly with affright.
If they were similar in aught.
Its passions and its modes of thought.
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Full of exasperating thought.
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
The early days of life we sought.
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Some day I’ll somehow finish it.
But now ridiculous a bit.
The master always used to sit.
E’en as the poet says he leant.
Like a full moon magnificent.
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
Angel or fiend malevolent.
With scandal’s trivial ornament.
Wherein a space Onéguine spent.
“You have a letter to me sent.
No answer! He another sent.
Time-honoured Kremlin’s keys present.
And scanned in silence its content.
An invalid from lung complaint.
And consolation soon begot.
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
One moment’s slumber suffer not.
Just at this moment I cannot.
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Examine her from head to foot.
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
A maiden’s secrets—of the heart.
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Wherein I buried left my heart.
May well in innocence impart.
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
A box of terrible import.
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
As if it were some funeral feast.
Had not yet withered his young breast.
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Which might for many ages last.
From shades of the relentless past.
Is once again made manifest.
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
“Nurse, ’tis so close I cannot rest.
Devoured them with an eager zest.
And so—God bless them, if He list.
They may forget that we exist.
Satan will jest, and at love’s cost.
God knows! The very trace is lost.
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
“My chum lives here,” Bruin grunts out.
Their claims and explanations shout.
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
The triumph of a conquest new.
Gazing upon a note below.
To end with him her path below.
Which falls in starry flakes below.
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
No obstacle of which I know.
“So thou art wed! I did not know.
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
And linen on him doth bestow.
We glide along a floor of wax.
And also fashionable beaux.
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
From Romulus unto our day.
She gazed around her—it was day.
As men who much had done that day.
Jilted—glad of a holiday.
To-morrow just like yesterday.
Well! just as she was yesterday.
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
The military band will play.
Was wont with me at cards to play.
For the young poet they display.
Another visit hastes to pay.
For folly’s dues thou hadst to pay.
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
His intellect in close array.
A cup of tea upon a tray.
Minutely I will now portray.
Transfixed Onéguine mine doth stay.
Onéguine Olga bore away.
And gallops to her house away.
As it were, tore himself away.
From the dread pistol turn away.
Without a chance to slip away.
Lost in the hamlet far away.
Take to their wings and fly away.
But I was sharp in times gone by.
And like a palisade flit by.
More crimson every moment they.
May find a crumb to satisfy.
Possess my love and sympathy.
“No matter, look immediately.
Or innocently past me fly.
Though he advanced unceasingly.
“Who will be there?”—“The family.
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
Have my Onéguine—suddenly.
To lay two covers secretly.
He drops his pistol silently.
The captain of a company.
Must now my stanzas occupy.
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
But my Tattiana’s eyes were dry.
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Alike by sighs and flattery.
With jealous fear, anxiety.
But man of sense and probity.
Charming with grave simplicity.
And mental elasticity.
And naked uniformity.
The blessings of humanity.
Have echoed to eternity.
The style of wise antiquity.
The child of sloth and liberty.
Thereon the passing traveller read:
And cool sagacious mind he had:
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
I should alarm our friendship tried:
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
And vows will probably be signed:
A happy destiny ordained:
And on the last one, underlined:
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Nought in the universe refused:
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Onéguine then approached and said:
Gazing into his face, she said:
In whispers low the neighbours said:
But finally she softly said:
Upon the opening page ye find:
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
To take a hand at whist oft come:
To sigh and meditate alone:
The aged woman in her woe:
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
The hostess doth interrogate:
But I came not to adulate:
By an obrok’s indulgent rate:
A philosophic anchorite:
These are your relatives, believe:
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Thus did our friend Onéguine preach:
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
There is no wreath upon the bough:
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
He had excepted from the ban:
All bustle when he makes a sign:
But boldly I myself resign:
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
The household property contain:
To raise a clamour and a din:
And tears of reconciliation:
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
And the cold beauties of the season:
He is not there: I am not known:
To romp and play she ne’er would go:
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
In true interpretation hates:
He enters: to the mill he drives:
Beats that of friends and relatives:
Our liberty at least survives:
The prince’s eye Onéguine seeks:
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
And the kind-hearted servitors:
With laughter smothered weariness:
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
The epitaph on marble shows:
And in a whisper did repeat:
All this, my friends, translate aright:
He somewhat blushing would omit:
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
A letter for her hero meant:
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Within resounded shriek and shout:
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
Olga’s admirer came that day:
And thus unto her nurse did say:
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
And starting suddenly doth say:
At first, I clung to secrecy:
With him were friends eternally:
Known unto children perfectly:
Which in the winter were a joy:
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
To be a charming mystery:
(Surely you know him as I speak);
Whene’er he had an aching head;
But presently she tried to read;
Bear gone—she at the threshold placed;
And cares not farther to proceed;
He took no more the slightest heed;
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
And to the field of honour led;
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
Tattiana o’er the stream complained;
My sum of happiness contained;
Love to idealize inclined;
Her features no grimaces bleared;
And many another slily sneered;
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
The fated nutriment desired;
Either she saw not or ignored;
Of Olga he in song averred;
Of censure for the same incurred;
On melted wax in water poured;
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
The style in which my hero dressed;
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
And she at last hath us deceived;
In much his conduct stigmatized;
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
Had rendered him an invalid;
Some wretched journal in his hand;
“Enough to see one winter’s end;
An ear to my confession lend;
The young proprietor we find;
It gradually possessed his mind;
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Such is the country custom good;
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Is still condemned in love to be;
“Do not—you might—suspicious be;
And then “monsieur” supplied her place;
The shining river clothed in ice;
And the extent of his caprice;
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
He wanders in his indolence;
I yield with a low reverence;
And glittering simpletons beside;
And the saloon threw open wide;
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
Placed at the customary range;
And a half rubles down gave she;
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
Shall my declining years beguile;
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
Of many an economic scheme;
All dark and silent hath become;
No longer through her former home;
With better half as cumbersome;
And irrigate them with champagne;
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
The sneers of critics superfine;
The lamps illuminating shine;
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
All that perfection could desire;
And our swift troikas never tire;
With it may be a couple more;
Away her golden earrings tore;
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
If seriously he hath disease;
She would pronounce à la Française;
Crushing and a confusing noise;
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
Inspired but weariness intense;
Furious he from the table rose;
All visited him at first, of course;
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
And stupid censors passionate;
But merely to exasperate;
I am not strong enough to state;
Without them Eugene is complete;
For I myself was thirteen quite;
I on my chosen hero dote;
With “vale” finish off a note;
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
Subscribed, toujours à vous, Annette;
Her all in all did constitute;
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
My heart with but one look revive;
“Ideas and time ne’er backward move;
They made him feel inclined to doze;
Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
And grant success to labour long;
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
Was the old and forgotten coach;
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
You’ll find her portrait there, I vouch;
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
I must resign myself, in sooth;
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
Restrained the impulses of youth;
Himself transformed into a hack;
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
Morality taught scarce at all;
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
Who from two years to thirty tell;
Pétòushkoff, the provincial swell;
Or couplets more ingenious still;
In order due the maidens pull;
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Will be absorbed by Lethe’s stream;
In three weeks would arrive for them;
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
Four deadly paces do they span;
I feel, allotted is my span;
Deep into debt his father ran;
And fields my joys have ever been;
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
From gales a hill behind was seen;
His friendship I acquired just then;
The tale of these romantic men;
Another his betrothed was given;
With roses, caps and looks malign;
At times talk nonsense with design;
Of love again, and yet again;
And agitate my heart again;
He there is master—that is plain;
And an habitual sense of pain;
After the wedded couple strain;
And far removed from rumour vain;
Not high in general estimation;
And sulked in silent indignation;
Our fathers used to dote upon;
There an imperious skeleton;
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
A jolly song and distant horn;
Delighted glances in return;
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
What everybody long has known;
She bows her head beneath the crown;
Have latterly vexatious grown;
When captured in a schoolboy’s cap;
Of roses to romancers dear;
Would once in powdered wig appear;
The shining orbs of night appear;
I then resolved my heart to tear;
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
Unhappily too salt by far;
Adroitly seized and carried her;
Though superannuated rather;
I’m beaten in another matter;
Spanned the unbridled torrent o’er;
Kvass needful was to them as air;
With the epistle of my fair;
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
Already dance to song proceeds;
And rising from her bench proceeds;
Of frivolous existence, friends;
With love which happiness extends;
Appear attuned to softer chords;
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
And nothing more important sees;
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
And fashion’s gay frivolities;
Between the stalls, along the toes;
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fêtes;
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
A victim decked with golden leaves;
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
May yet be studious of his nails;
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
’Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
Me your perfections would not bless;
And contemplative dreaminess;
“But strange am I to happiness;
Their slander e’en was weariness;
With spiritual tenderness;
To fawn upon and love express;
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
He shunned those parties boisterous;
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Onéguine his excuses says;
And at economy was great;
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
Wherein I castigation get;
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
Or but for fame he saw the light;
An ever transcendental flight;
Terror of guardians of the night;
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
And glasses unemployed all night;
And form a network left and right;
And better, if I judge aright;
As yet none had discovered aught;
I am not worthy them in aught;
’Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
And my dark soul to light was brought;
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
Now talkative, now reticent;
First reconciled and then content;
And all the three to breakfast went;
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
Ourselves as unities to count;
Onéguine lightning glances shot;
Inseparable from our lot;
My country and an exile’s lot;
“Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
To Russ indigenous are not;
Within her; she is sick at heart;
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
Must e’en despise his kind at last;
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
A life in common with the rest;
For treachery had done its worst;
On lines invisible are fixt;
He offers her his murderous paw;
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
And herds of oxen wandering low;
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Her handkerchief she loses now;
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
And roofs near morn blanched o’er with snow;
And all your love on self bestow;
Flew to collect his rural tax;
“How often in thine arms I lay;
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
But it grew late; he must not stay;
He still made love in a queer way;
Carried a truth divine away;
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
Simeon Petròvitch just as shabby;
To idle musing was a prey;
The witching light of sympathy;
At least by show of sympathy;
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
Upon his couch insensibly;
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
I would not part with finally;
Tattiana suffered secretly;
The same warm vision constantly;
And turned aside the drapery;
Must bow in common courtesy;
Of Russian domesticity;
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
And gently hovered o’er my head?
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Asunder was and hate prepared?
I write to you! Is more required?
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
A bastard fame prohibited?
But from the interview what flowed?
And is all light within destroyed?
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
That I to you reveal my mind?
Of which the rustling woods remind?
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
Selfish nonentities around?
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Why did you visit our poor place?
Again in her ethereal dance?
“Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
This lot in life with stern decree?
Tender and elevated, free?
And leads a solitary life?
But I—what is all this to me?
What is thy cleverness to me?
“And is it long since back he came?
How in the country pass this time?
In the lone garden and the lane?
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
He has returned, say in what guise?
“Is he the same or grown more wise?
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
She muses: “What was Olga’s fate?
In charming fashion mutilate?
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
Affection how did you requite?
“Then, in the country, is’t not true?
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
To standards in which we believe?
Where is he who doth not deceive?
What I by relatives conceive?
Depart in peace and friendly live?
What boots it with the age to strive?
Again the plague of boyhood—love?
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
And who is not a tiresome thief?
Ye golden days of my young spring?
The days which to your youth belong?
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
The native Russian tongue impeach?
He salutary rules poured forth?
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
Of a heart cold and cynical?
What will the coming dawn reveal?
Are all your relatives quite well?
“Is she in love?” quoth one. “With whom?
“Had he been long here, and where from?
In little maidens of thirteen?
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Detest him for a brother slain?
Can lower depths beyond remain?
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
I loved you—what did I obtain?
Where—”—“What! another eclogue spin?
My friends, what means this odd digression?
Without disgust we look upon?
And dream of life’s delightful dawn?
But tell me what am I to do?
So irremissible appear?
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
For which no springtime shall appear?
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
What is his latest character?
My goddesses, where are your shades?
Qu’ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
And what from its recess appears?
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Attractive in its banefulness?
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
This gentle daring who could guess?
Who labours hard to humour us?
Oh! who is not calumnious?
Perverse, unfavourable views?
Or parody of modern ways?
Who cannot conjure former joys?
With so much warmth and intellect?
“To whom is it to go, my sweet?
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
In the first place, say, am I right?
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Whither along them doth he pelt?
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
Or torturer malevolent?
Keep your accounts! You’d rather not?
Whither departed is the host?
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
And where may be her sister now?
Deep in the greenwood far away?
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Or other mask donned playfully?
With clouded brow stands silently?
The happiest days of life employ?
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
And husbands’ tedious amity?
In that morass where you and I
But were it not immoral I
Another! to none other I
But with her elder sister I
But who abandon it—as I
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
In former years thus did not I
Yet let us part in friendship, O
Upon the highway of the sea
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
Onéguine’s Letter to Tattiana
And silent as the maid Svetlana
Next Saturday. The Làrina
Opened the portals of the tomb
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
Or for the solitary tomb
Thinking: ’tis foolish to disturb
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
But on the third of grove and mead
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
Do not excuse yourself. I read
For on their brows I trembling read
A little farther please to read
I Apuleius gladly read
And it may be a secret dread
Nor slander viciously could spread
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Although we know that Eugene had
Inhabited the country, clad
But Lenski, I should be so glad
He dragged her by a forest road
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
Undressed herself and went to bed
With hopeless passion: from her bed
And finally, upon his bed
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Except one by the window placed
He on his bosom gently placed
In coach or post-cart duly placed
The ancient barshtchina replaced
The two old ladies then embraced
At Làrina’s abode produced
Most by this circumstance offended
Thither in future to proceed
Will not five centuries exceed
Remarkable. She then indeed
“Enough, arise! for much we need
Up to the attic, and all need
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Whene’er across the plain at speed
From the moist cork the bottle freed
But the date subsequently changed
By visions who was ne’er deranged
A careless looker-on estranged
And in society might shed
My mother-in-law who lately died
Vice in romance is glorified
But now our minds are mystified
The princess from the sofa cried
To sketch myself that I have tried
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
But since to the backdoor they led
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
Nor marked how summer’s prime had fled
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
Of London life is “vulgar” called
Is it that I am now compelled
The channel of the river stilled
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
Surely ye all have overhauled
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
Transparent o’er the Neva beamed
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
She never of deception dreamed
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Onéguine was—so many deemed
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
And endless the cotillon seemed
When hope’s delightful flower but bloomed
How soon to habits she conformed
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Only her countenance assumed
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Where many another hand had signed
Her money counted, and designed
Though, God be praised! he ne’er designed
Caricatures he now designed
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
What do I ask? What cause assigned
Whose hearts responsive have remained
O ye whom tender love hath pained
And saying this Vladimir drained
At fifty who relief obtained
He sang of life’s fresh colours stained
The fruits of learning and combined
His chambers close wherein confined
The venerable dame opined
Now a long branch itself entwined
Constant affection intertwined
If the fond hope I could have fanned
There, aping Gulnare’s bard, he spanned
Tattiana more than ever burned
His neighbour’s lowly tomb and mourned
Into the cups already sped
Their glory with their heels of red
Of his approach; but nothing cared
A faithful model she appeared
To an assembly—she appeared
But this a heinous crime appeared
But in the drawing-room all appeared
With Olga; nor of this appeared
He went not—sooner was prepared
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Upon the Don’s broad pastures bred
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
By indolence and languor fired
How like the billow I desired
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
Tattiana every day conferred
In the recesses what hath stirred
And by a partial temper stirred
Whilst from her countenance ne’er stirred
Onéguine’s speeches I abhorred
At first, but soon became inured
In fact, some people were assured
The contact of the foot I raised
And leaning ’gainst the portal closed
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Alas! for now before her passed
At home arriving he addressed
At times three words to him addressed
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
Replaced them in their box, undressed
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
But once more pensive and distressed
Then weeping she sank back distressed
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
The maid whose note he still possessed
If the poor maiden could have guessed
He ought to have conciliated
Nor long his mind was agitated
And life and fate in turn selected
Tattiana with impatience waited
Vladimir Lenski visited
By Olga’s hand distributed
And every year distributed
All mothers their sweet girls believed
Upon those margins she perceived
At an old aunt’s they had arrived
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
The conversation was revived
Who had for four long years survived
When but a boy he Olga loved
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Already by repentance moved
And these the attentive maid observed
And ancient usages observed
And numerous pages had preserved
They in a peaceful life preserved
But proudly in his song preserved
Et cetera; but nothing showed
He gazed upon the clock which showed
A scant attendance Lenski showed
Onéguine ne’er as poet showed
The insensate fire of love still glowed
Enraptured was he if allowed
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
That we her constantly betrayed
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Yet was her inmost soul o’erjoyed
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
And vehemently though amazed
With tenderness hath recognized
For which the poet agonized
And many a day thereafter laid
And, hanging down her head, the maid
Beneath her parents’ eyes the maid
At early morn returns the maid
Singing inside her hut the maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
Adieu she to the matron said
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
Vladimir something curtly said
And spectacles, his knitting staid
So be it! Just the laws which bid
Better than Chateaubriand did
Returning, from his ship amid
She dreamt she journeyed o’er a field
And thus in season the rich field
What are they? Gladly would I yield
And can it be? But late a child
And Limburg cheese alive and old
He took the room wherein the old
These evenings as in days of old
Tattiana in traditions old
The wolf upon the highways bold
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
Her Moscow cousin, often told
In dreams and what the moon foretold
To Olga frequently he would
She promised Eugene, or she would
Of friends unceremonious would
The Neva’s Cleopatra, and
With blessings on the ditches and
Her tears flow plentifully and
Exist—that their immortal band
Than health, so with a trembling hand
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
And in the bathroom did command
Sickness more courage doth command
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
To dream upon the sunny strand
Immersed in secret thought I stand
None the conviction could withstand
And had with waddling in the end
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
A passionate desire to bend
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
In duel having killed his friend
Their natural attractions lend
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
Yet I in idleness expend
Quick to the country let us wend
But what astonished do I find
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Infallibly you there will find
His immorality of mind
From mere vacuity of mind
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
Onéguine’s pencillings. His mind
And the recesses of my mind
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Lo! in my garden was she found
Examined, mended, newly found
This monument of thought profound
From hence engrossed in thought profound
Endless conjectures all propound
Imperial portraits hang around
And from the country all around
The German baker looks around
The snows from off the hills around
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
And by the fiddle’s rushing sound
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
The Russian N with nasal sound
Soon Olga’s accents shrill resound
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
If he had only known the wound
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
Absorbed in melancholy mood
But such is not for me. I brood
Whose author nature understood
Dark was the valley and the wood
Triquet arose, and for the bard
He was no more! The youthful bard
In love’s campaigns Onéguine heard
What never was remarked or heard
When in the grand saloon was heard
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
Tattiana would have gladly heard
And ought he not to disregard
The poet’s madness? for ’tis hard
“I won’t detain you; but ’tis hard
What doth she see? Around the board
Whose qualities appeared to afford
Sighs on another than her lord
Together they returned, nor word
And never hath our language proud
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
Onéguine whither gallops? Ye
Feelings which long had ceased to be
And this fifth canto ought to be
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Whilst he “belle Nina” had the face
I never should have seen your face
But gazes on Onéguine’s face
“She who with melancholy face
Onéguine—the beloved place
And after them at headlong pace
At the front gates, but in brief space
And who the rent-roll of his race
What acrimonious scorn I trace
Behold! than polished floor more nice
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
Euphonious, though I know a spice
Upon the table in a trice
The excited hero in a trice
But contrary to her advice
And his strange conduct at the dance
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
In serious mood or dalliance
His momentary loving glance
A pensive sorrow in her glance
Who by a haughty word or glance
In groups, official striplings glance
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Or will my melancholy glance
When people with long countenance
Seek the forgotten countenance
I heard thy voice’s resonance
And views amongst themselves advance
Of her provincial innocence
Then to reward such confidence
Her amorous experience
But this adventure’s consequence
It may be that his martyred shade
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
In the Lyceum’s noiseless shade
Beneath the sheltering oak tree’s shade
There, there, beneath the side-scene’s shade
He whom we sing to shall be made
Straight for the entrance then he made
Though the foul vision promise made
For our amusement ever made
Whose heart experience icy made
A certain little escapade
The goddess would a masquerade
But cannot anyhow evade
Like Leonora did she ride
Unto the windmill he must ride
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A bearded postillion astride
Yes, happy—though she at his side
But grown familiar side by side
Jaws are at work. On every side
Mute glances interchanged aside
And soon Onéguine’s door beside
Always together, eventide
And death before the husband wide
And unto whom we all allude
Then, then—well, in some solitude
Where long time he in solitude
In worldly din or solitude
Since Eugene in that solitude
My scholar without aptitude
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Then, I say truly, none but thee
’Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
When shall I wing my passage free
Yet sometimes pages two or three
Tome of “Malvina,” and but three
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
He usually was glad to see
He in the early years of life
Commence a new career in life
Should be respected throughout life
So be it! But internal strife
Wherein the miserable wife
By children and by faithful wife
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
And testy gamesters do engage
A visionary personage
As once, to fill the rapid page
Saint Priest, who every album’s page
With humble prose I’ll fill my page
As storms which in chill autumn rage
Thus having braved Apollo’s rage
Another could her woe assuage
Each gave Tattiana’s arm a nudge
For two whole days it seemed a change
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
But sweeter still it is to arrange
Again a century should scourge
That girl whom once on a time he
For empty sound the rascal swore he
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
All are amazed; but Lenski he
Three mortal hours per diem he
Tania well nigh expired when he
And by a sweet delusion he
Dressed like a London dandy he
Voices and hands applaud, and she
And in her native language she
Nor on the letter yet hath she
And disappear in space; then she
Men love no more, as only the
And an encouragement did breathe
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
They first of all my brow did wreathe
Upon the earth a mist did lie
When deaf and silent he doth lie
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
He deemed his friends but longed to make
For law I far niente take
My sportive Muse I used to take
And every morning I awake
To burn, yet reason keep awake
Or any trifle else ye like
By computation) it is like
Then suddenly discharge a joke
And barely visible the smoke
How artless was the note which spoke
Nor the frost particles inhale
But now in her effulgence pale
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
Espying, Eugene with a smile
That afterwards with evil smile
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Cannot they amicably smile
But he desired not to beguile
The Russian language I deem vile
Long listen, comprehend the whole
Preserves and an eternal prattle
The crystals of her vestibule
Though correspondence as a rule
And a romance in ancient style
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
But when the winter season came
Tattiana faltered, and became
Nor by her beauty she became
Whene’er a brilliant courtly dame
In hopes of everlasting fame
And at the altar of their fame
By recklessness amuse or shame
Believe me, of my present shame
Is it that ardent souls of flame
Who knows? with love’s consuming flame
More blooming than the Boreal flame
And in addition youth is flame
But fashionable hatred’s flame
We are the first who such a name
A finished madrigal would frame
And my romance’s open theme
And then the stanzas of my theme
Who reads his visionary theme
He with an innocence extreme
Until the sleepless Bréguet chime
His footing on the treacherous rime
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
She is an angel! We sometime
Though to the Academy I come
Nor shall the caterpillar come
Tiresome unto her hath become
His name: the tenderness of home
Long, long the hour had past when home
Time was, two maidens from their home
The Princess N. will be at home
Homeward returning, he at home
Oft staring through the window pane
Undeviating and insane
Struck Lenski dead—across the scene
But shall depict the touching scene
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
The village wherein yawned Eugene
The strife grew furious and Eugene
He was in error; for Eugene
She rose—departed. But Eugene
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
Are turned upon her. All combine
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
“Departed Lenski here to dine
Behold the dames who once were fine
A single being: ’twas in fine
And make a dark existence shine
He could in disputation shine
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Dreaming herself the heroine
Never upon my heroine
Tattiana’s Letter to Onéguine
Lest the world or her lord divine
Before the dregs they shall divine
Another bard with art divine
With loud explosion, the bright wine
But that the eyes of every one
The sum of my existence gone
Can she have been a moment gone
The river’s bank. Tattiana lone
Having for money’s sake alone
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
Certainly not Eugene alone
When, sitting by his fire alone
’Twas these he read and these alone
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Moina recalls for this alone
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
And in the frosty night alone
That mediocrity alone
Though around honoured Priam’s throne
That like a friendly voice its tone
Said something in an undertone
She murmurs in an undertone
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
Could in romantic mantle drape
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
O Men, how very like ye are
Here I remark all poets are
Albums magnificent which scare
The vile seducer shall not dare
Though I confess I hardly dare
Or vainly ’mid luxurious fare
With Ozeroff was wont to share
You with stern countenance declare
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
The riot of the world and glare
The crash of music, candles’ glare
And the more surely we ensnare
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
Which in the elevated sphere
And Eugene soon discovered there
The young Simeonova too there
It may be ye were born, or there
Was born beside the Neva, where
He bends his course to Talon’s, where
Faces which we meet everywhere
As if impossible it were
Would haste in agitation dire
Authors replete with sacred fire
The proud ones are not worth the fire
For our Automedons are fire
Their privileged allurements fire
With our Onéguine doth aspire
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Yet still apparently aspire
He deemed his coming would inspire
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
So ardently did I desire
To mutter her concealed desire
He felt the laudable desire
But Lenski, having no desire
Adieu! whate’er thou didst desire
With thee I conversed when I bore
Within my memory I bore
Opened with care, and entering bore
Or, as it were, the Freischutz’ score
The Russian winter did adore
And the young girl appeared before
He was deceived. Just as before
How oft to the Crimean shore
To help her to the other shore
’Tis time to quit this weary shore
As if against obstruction sore
A gust of passion never tore
Endowing us from out her store
As bees who leave their dainty store
Bouyànoff too, my cousin, wore
“But which, my dear?—In days of yore
But competition I abjure
For long—for ever. To be sure
Then my companions young with pleasure
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
And then she soon ’twixt work and leisure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
That my dishonour would ensure
Serious endeavours to assure
And after Albion’s proud lyre
Ye need dissimulation base
That a friend’s arm in every case
Napoleon tarried till it please
O epic Muse, my powers increase
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Address to you one single phrase
To russify the foreign phrase
Who every gesture, every phrase
It matters not. Hope e’en to these
She mourned and to the moon would raise
And in her languid bosom raise
And where the billows hoarsely raise
Away! and cease to ring their praise
Because he could not gourmandise
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
Where melancholy rocks arise
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Of the night sentinels arise
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
The Làrinas were since sunrise
But now a question in this wise
Olga began to long likewise
And I admired their common sense
We hear with interest intense
A curious interest disclose
When, wise at length, we seek repose
And where at last his bones repose
But better loved the soft repose
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
He enters. High the cork arose
That for that matter in my verse
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Detecting him the passing horse
Most usually a Cossack horse
Departed, ordered out his horse
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
Oh, many a year hath run its course
The monsters of the British Muse
Now for the first time I my Muse
But I must now employ my Muse
Incited by his stormy Muse
I once forgot for your sweet cause
I lift a warning voice because
Whose memory doth not refuse
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
But what results? His eyes peruse
They would not solemnly debate
My famous portrait indicate
But this amusement delicate
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
He was most gay. The happy date
That is, he could elucidate
On Lenski’s matrimonial fate
The servants used to congregate
Both were expectant of the hate
Both were of passion satiate
Excruciate the heart and late
The time for mystic strolls which late
That year the autumn season late
A promenade in twilight late
Sometime collected, shall relate
“But tell me, nurse, can you relate
Desirous to annihilate
How soon he learnt to titillate
But round the hostess scintillate
Two hearts perchance were desolate
Longtime was her heart desolate
The world enough. Congratulate
Just at the hour we designate
But if my lot unfortunate
’Tis fearful to anticipate
To whom we used to consecrate
Spoiled children most degenerate
You in the least commiserate
Or “Idol mio,” and in the grate
When o’er a glass with friends we prate
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
Your frankness I shall compensate
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Eternally to imitate
The secrets of the marriage state
These take their seats; the coach of state
’Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
Around my stanzas incomplete
When poets lachrymose recite
Was certainly not erudite
A bottle of a vintage white
Its ebullition foaming white
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Highways all Russia will unite
Happy who thereto can unite
But I must add to what I write
By Olga stood, dejected quite
Fond declarations they invite
Your innocent and charming note
A dagger, asterisk, or note
To purest love he tuned his note
In spring-time, heard the cygnet’s note
When in simplicity ye wrote
But Lenski madrigals ne’er wrote
We must admit but little taste
And she despite herself would waste
This anchorite amid his waste
And the cast-iron statuette
From whose analysis minute
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
My country’s honour and repute
“Me?”—“Yes! It is Tattiana’s fête
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
Did they not all the Russian tongue
Onéguine knew enough, the rogue
He racked his brains to find its clue
His vanity first let us pique
Ah! it may be, affection true
I did not please you. Why pursue
Without the faintest trace to leave
But now our hero we must leave
Into delicious bondage gave
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
But where Melpomene doth rave
A prudent man like you and brave
And thy inebriating wave
And her bespangled robe doth wave
But my Onéguine the whole eve
Just at a moment which I grieve
And that too often we receive
So meantime let him joyous live
But I await thee: scarce alive
The most industrious man alive
And our successors soon shall drive
And yet he in your cause would strive
When that time comes, a poem I’ll strive
There our Katènine did revive
Along the hall, and high above
That guests approach: and when above
The malady of hopeless love
Maidens before her meekly move
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
’Twas then he loved the tangled grove
A thick immense neglected grove
Gently for pranks he would reprove
Time was when cold seduction strove
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
Desire to rule ye may observe
And supper. In the country we
With footsteps tremulous with awe
Striking the intellect with awe
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
And reads with rapid eager eye
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
On iron bridges we shall gaze
Looks upon all with absent gaze
And long her eyes as through a haze
No, never in the early blaze
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
A hand of ice appeared to seize
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Who now could fail to recognize
The calm existence which I prize
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
And honestly ’tis my belief
This great discovery relief
Habit alleviates the grief
Who in the agony of grief
To whom are our misfortunes grief
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
Gvozdine, Bouyànoff, Pétòushkoff
But stop! I will present thee, if
To write of any other elf
Even beneath her parents’ roof
The language of her girlish pleading
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Basins and jugs—well! everything
And an old gent the poet marking
Also one Viázemski, remarking
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Amidst successes flattering
In life domestic see a string
Follow up love—a secret meeting
Metreless verses recognizing
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
He thought to write, but labour long
The lively trash of stories long
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
Who following Petrarch move along
Terpsichore alone among
And thus he never fell among
And wild festivities among
And oft at eventide a throng
He quits the fashionable throng
To whom amongst the jealous throng
With little knowledge and that wrong
Spring’s paramour, pours forth her song
A double force unto their song
Let me explain that in my song
Since I beheld Eugene and young
“I celebrate a comrade young
Her sisterhood delights the young
His harp beneath that sky had rung
He who life’s frosts which early wrung
For Moscow fops and Circes each
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Did not their lips with foreign speech
Many an ancient legend which
Would she the canvas tight enrich
Who to surrender did not blench
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
But home his body to despatch
I formerly admired her much
And many a caravan on high
The tiny sun shone less on high
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Careless of fame his spirit high
And from the misty woodland nigh
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Heaved an involuntary sigh
And the eternal lorgnette through
And pressed her hand—the crimson blush
Or counting on his uncle’s death
When motionless your gaze beneath
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
Or even overcome by wrath
But memory like a serpent’s tooth
The dusty chronicles of earth
To dire contentment shall give birth
His wadded coat and cap with peak
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
And the sagacious Triquet back
In truth he had the happy trick
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
The artful prisoner should seek
A door he opens. But why shrank
Yon silly moon upon the brink
His fist Onéguine fiercely shook
But somehow there shone in his look
Calling to mind your icy look
The little solitary nook
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And clad in airy costume took
Jealousy and vexation took
Caught him and by the collar took
Till absently Vladimir took
But trembling on the mirror dark
There, when the rains of spring we mark
Assemblies oligarchical
What sad emotions o’er me steal
For promises her feet reveal
And with gray hair ambrosial
Lo! with what pride celestial
Nought of its charms original
Yet suffering emotional
He deemed of human life the goal
When first upon my cheek I feel
On him spleen mounted sentinel
Though of romance therein I fail
In time I’ll give ye without fail
Winter’s approach she doth not hail
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
Herds low, and under night’s dark veil
The rigour of cold pride and all
Nor years of separation all
Bedding is laid out and to all
God grant I meet not at a ball
Another tribune of the ball
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Yet as a rule their talk I call
She soon forgot, began to call
Was that which we are wont to call
And finally he deigns let fall
They blossom, ripen and they fall
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Some future ignoramus shall
A white and undulating pall
Lord Byron’s portrait on the wall
The inscription o’er the gates of Hell
Long in this fashionable cell
For consecrate to me he fell
Repentance wields not now her spell
Of languor and of love did tell
’Twas not the first time, I can tell
For your instruction here to tell
The steward sent a note to tell
“I am in love,” her whispers tell
A worthy object ’tis, and well
And gallicisms I love as well
And sometimes into snares as well
Onéguine acted very well
Ennui can in the country dwell
“’Tis habit, Lenski.”—“Is your ill
Proceeds, until she from a hill
The pervert world with icy chill
’Tis now the hillock now the rill
His heart reciprocated still
With tumult or contentment still
Time was, the poet’s tender quill
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Thus a guest with composure will
’Tis evidently Heaven’s will
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
Rings from a dish of water full
Perched on a goose’s neck a skull
And Eugene ever in her soul
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
Tattiana’s eyes with tender gleam
But Tania just as in a dream
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
But sweeter in a midnight dream
Awaiting on the shore I roam
And a malicious epigram
And love’s delicious diadem
Of priceless value all things seem
He hath acquired the world’s esteem
And true, his pistol’s faultless aim
Is ever ready to proclaim
In winter by its blank and dim
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
And the lime alley’s twilight dim
Silent, oracular ye’d see him
Its driver seated on the rim
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
The forests in mysterious gloom
All slumber. In the drawing-room
She nerves herself from her alarm
Fantastic images shall swarm
Laid down his life of sun and storm
A Russian poem’s mechanism
And I discerned through Fancy’s prism
Indeed, by force of magnetism
How like a poet was my chum
Meantime I’ll finish whilst I can
Romances three, in which ye scan
Onéguine slowly then began
And my Tattiana now began
Vladimir’s property, a man
Portrayed contemporary man
Eugene directs the trusty man
“Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
Portray the solitary den
There friends of pure delight had been
Assuredly should not have been
Had a deluded victim been
Obedient she had ever been
What a storm of emotions keen
Was nothing but the British spleen
The lonely mansion-house to screen
Before him red roast beef is seen
His malady, whose cause I ween
The cold reply with gloomy mien
Approach not to hearken
To pass with reasonable men
Amid submissive herds of men
The poet fell; already men
I know that Parny’s tender pen
The imagination to enliven
The memory of the bard was driven
Onéguine was a citizen
But when Tattiana’s hand had ta’en
But scarce had maids their saucers ta’en
Which never have existed, e’en
Perchance upon the Neva e’en
Become a faithful wife and e’en
“Come,” she cried, “sister, tell me e’en
My joy in youth was fleeting e’en
It blew: it howled: till winter e’en
Men opposite. The cross they sign
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
But to the garden once again
The youthful lover once again
That until Christmas comes again
A maid hath oft, may yet again
Tattiana courage doth regain
Who selfishly unmoved remain
And gave himself but little pain
And thus it is ’twould cause me pain
Spare yourself unavailing pain
I know not if his heart felt pain
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
Tania the meaning would obtain
Although her book did not contain
His daughter’s book to ascertain
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
But by degrees the crowd begin
With words of foreign origin
At morn an icy bath within
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
In books he saw nought to condemn
And gossip of the town and fashion
But Tania ne’er displayed a passion
With quite a lachrymose expression
He enters: rapidly discussion
Who without more prevarication
We all of us of education
Onéguine went with trepidation
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
But Eugene, hating litigation
With inexact pronunciation
Upon her cheek by adulation
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Enhances love in estimation
Invigorate imagination
Long time her young imagination
She did not think “procrastination
Their Jealousy and separation
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
The idols of their adoration
In pages of a love narration
The poet’s fervid conversation
Without constraint in conversation
Alone within his habitation
And long internal agitation
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
By what idea or observation
With intellect and strong volition
Meantime Onéguine’s apparition
Lenski the foeman’s apparition
Quite a sensation; the position
For journalistic deglutition
The same unmoved oblivion
Beneath the silver of the moon
And now ’tis night, the guardian moon
His wife was also mad upon
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
She was thus fond of Richardson
Or that adoring Grandison
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
To write his forefathers to warn
Silvers the brook; the shepherd’s horn
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
Men will forget me, but my urn
Do we alone our losses mourn
Then to some gallant in your turn
Or, heedless of the leaves’ return
“But lo! forth from the valleys dun
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
As when the tempest’s veil is drawn
In silence shall I sit and yawn
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
Impelled to union with his own
Troy’s sages should in concert own
He left you first, and I must own
The untutored spirit’s pangs calmed down
And on the footstool sitting down
I feel thou wast by God sent down
In a half-open dressing-gown
Besides, a duellist well-known
Have one by one all withered grown
Whither at headlong speed doth go
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
But say he was a genius who
Pen, paper bring: the table too
Inspired him with disgust and so
For was it not her duty to
No more remembered him; unto
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
Together moments one or two
Zaretski paces thirty-two
The lady in the crimson cap
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
With iridescent wing doth flap
Mountains we’ll level and through deep
Long time in meditation deep
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
Far from the rest the pair would creep
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
With one foot resting on its tip
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
He bending whispered in her ear
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
From everything the heart held dear
I can’t conceive a little dear
As in some frenzied dream of fear
A smile from slumbering nature clear
To be in conversation clear
There is a spot the village near
Mysteriously all objects near
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
When youth’s rebellious hour drew near
He daily in his drives drew near
Shy, silent did the maid appear
But still more stupid did appear
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Doth in us or our names appear
“How Tania grows! Doth it appear
More advantageously appear
A vision desolate and drear
All is foreseen. My secret drear
Modest yet daring! And a tear
The simple epitaph—a tear
And grown more curious by far
And from the Millionaya afar
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And traces with a slender finger
Tania doth by the casement linger
Doth love’s incautiousness in her
Not a bad fellow was her father
Gravely repeating to another
And courtier, fop, and usurer
Appear; along the road of Tver
At Russ she was by no means clever
Hope with her fascinating power
I tremble lest my humble prayer
Though hitherto a lady ne’er
Together we have wandered o’er
Now her lithe form she arches o’er
Finally tost his arms in air
Urging your droshkies swift as air
Mark ye with what a modest air
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
I have dreamed many a vision fair
The less we love a lady fair
I uttered to my lady fair
Pray is it not a tough affair
A kerchief round her silver hair
Approaches Olga and the pair
Accents of rapture or despair
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
Lest the malicious reader or
Anicia soon appears, the door
But gray Phillippevna the door
She cannot—Eugene oped the door
Upon the ball-room’s glassy floor
Some one or other editor
And sermon—but in that dread hour
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
And at the stages bugs and fleas
Pélagie Nikolavna has
With tranquil air Onéguine leads
His wife approaches, with him leads
If they but heard domestic loads
’Twas eve. ’Twas dusk. The river speeds
To bring behind: the triple steeds
Are ye replaced by other maids
Tattiana to a corner, bids
In winter, when Night longer holds
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Thus in the earth the seed expands
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The father scarcely understands
With bated breath, around she bends
Tattiana from the hill descends
Their harmless conversation blends
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
His hate by slander, and who spends
O feet, where’er your path extends
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
At least their accents and their words
Whom autocratic fate’s decrees
May be that I by heaven’s decrees
To understand by slow degrees
The serpent to unlawful trees
Not the least trace Onéguine sees
She fears and like an arrow rushes
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
And overcome antipathies
The shutters open; to the skies
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
When the same life before him lies
Tattiana to the index flies
O’erwhelmed with guests; by families
Ever to hear the same replies
His friends and also enemies
Thrice happy who their agonies
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
She from the winter corn espies
’Tis silent all! Alone the cries
Upon those pages she descries
Even the rosy wafer dries
And alphabetically tries
Who glory, wealth and dignities
The country hath its liberties
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The guests make room; aside each takes
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
’Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
But lights incendiary flames
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
To banish far unworthy themes
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
Alas! he loved as in our times
I sail upon my lake at times
And the young revellers of past times
The fisher’s fire afar illumes
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Attentive be unto my rhymes
And an enchanting shoulder shines
Her head upon her breast declines
Longer the East inert reclines
Into the tangled garden goes
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
The husband comes and interferes
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
And still the coachmen round the fires
Compassion now or wrath inspires
And now his youthful heart desires
Seated, a curious look with glasses
Shouts of applause! Onéguine passes
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
To the pianoforte he moves
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
At the same hour she oped her eyes
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
But finally he oped his eyes
Olga he sees before his eyes
Where every day before his eyes
For tallow, wood and other things
His travels like all other things
All that industrial London brings
All this in many cases brings
Happy and glorious. But this brings
And now she skips and now she springs
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Slow circling round its fellow swings
How pleasantly the evening jogs
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Eugene, more tolerant than this
If ye but knew how dreadful ’tis
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
However, the mazurka lacks
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
The early tinkling of the bells
Which of approaching labour tells
When the sonorous Bréguet tells
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
And where Thalia softly dreams
Descended swift in turbid streams
And where the admirable streams
Their memory lingers still and seems
Awhile sound conversation seems
Glory with which our history teems
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
In Olga’s and Tattiana’s rooms
A windmill too a jig performs
Insensible her hand remains
Priams of country populations
Old people’s simple conversations
Their offspring’s innocent flirtations
They were the wonderful traditions
In country towns, where still it keeps
I will not wed, and ever weeps
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
The two friends’ compliments she hears
Tattiana in the yard appears
Mournful Love’s deadly trace appears
Distracted by her grief appears
Likewise an epitaph with tears
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
For visions of my childish years
With Eugene pranks of former years
And judgment which unsteady veers
Tattiana certainly infers
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Nor boston nor the world’s affairs
To the theatre he repairs
And where a madrigal occurs
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
The manners of the highest class
And from his dressing-room would pass
Both day and night he now must pass
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Divinity without access
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
How flourish, why and wherefore less
Also their feet—yet ne’ertheless
With fir-trees standing motionless
Speech was so tame and colourless
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
To loiter there in idleness
A child devoid of childishness
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Amid the awful emptiness
Where my days in the wilderness
My lot is fixed—with thoughtlessness
Is it that human restlessness
Whose hands indulgently caress
Meantime in matutinal dress
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
But Eugene long hath left the press
Wherefore regarding him express
I like the difference to express
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Inflict annoyance and distress
Her agitation and distress
Habit was given us in distress
Nor discontinued to distress
If wife and children to possess
If the raw product they possess
The uncontaminated kiss
Have felt love’s agitated kiss
Even amusing fools we miss
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
Beside the thundering abyss
Whom latterly one often meets
Past darkened windows and long streets
As formerly the shepherd sits
The maiden at her casement sits
She visited the humble tents
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Ever receive with kindly hearts
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
We Russians, friends from distant parts
The Paris of those country parts
Deliberate approach of guests
And like Napoleons each of us
Well! Làrina appears to us
Though for his Helen Menelaus
A million bipeds reckons thus
Whereto in language courteous
Yea! although rendered beauteous
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
The conversation tedious
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
Amid sly, pusillanimous
It was a cheery, generous
Come sing we in chorus
The friend of liberty and laws
And through the lofty windows views
The men salute with lower bows
Mends with the Russian hammer’s blows
When Passion’s fire no longer glows
Before a fire which feebly glows
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
The first appearance of the snows
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
Through dense aristocratic rows
The connoisseur his glances throws
Of fiery youth’s untutored days
Alas! the friend of childish days
That vanished are my youthful days
As the sins of my youthful days
And then to meditate for days
And I confess that now-a-days
In one of thine enchanting lays
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
Alas! my stomach it betrays
When he in ardent verse portrays
Delighted much his former ways
Unto Anicia for the keys
A joyous troop of little boys
Approach not to gaze at
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
Ere this but one brief moment beat
With lovers’ rubbish filled, was neat
I might to connoisseurs repeat
Now all things round about repeat
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
On this artistical retreat
Till out of breath upon a seat
Happy who quit life’s banquet seat
Her brow she did not e’en contract
Of keen sarcastic intellect
The perfidies I recollect
Two verses he could recollect
So prudent, and so circumspect
The glass unwittingly inspect
The disenchanted glass direct
Wherein the child of fashion strict
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
Where fashionable circles meet
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
Near Khariton’s in a side street
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
That heart with inspiration sweet
The words and looks of charmers sweet
But time flies and she doth forget
Ah! I still struggle to forget
And by that shady rivulet
Without enthusiasm he met
When in her walks abroad she met
The hour when—Fate so willed—we met
Then in the silent cabinet
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
On whom a sister’s heart was set
It will be by a mob beset
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
For twice you came to them and yet
Onéguine, hast forgotten yet
Raises within my breast as oft
Born of a babbler in a loft
But from the Muses’ loftiest height
Eight times the heroes of the fight
All about Olga—to a light
As a babe’s slumber, or the light
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
And showed with an uncertain light
That the two friends with morning’s light
But lo! already the moon’s light
Yet clearer shines than every light
In my young days of wild delight
Who in thy love finds more delight
In such an album with delight
And with emotional delight
He finally lost all delight
The votary of vain delight
And like the prisoner’s our delight
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
When tea was brought. ’Tis my delight
If in the scenes of home I might
The china teapot too ye might
Time was, a valiant general might
Resounding through all ages might
Full many a lovely star hath night
How oft, when on a summer night
That glimmered through the radiant night
My morning birdie, yesternight
His ditties were as pure and bright
And is it true her garland bright
’Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
When I yon semicircle bright
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Adorned with many a vision bright
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
And never was the ear affright
Before whose inexperienced sight
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
As on the rapid wings of thought
Because in singleness of thought
’Tis noisome to her there: in thought
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
She hears of conversation nought
At first such contradictions wrought
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
My memory wandered wide and sought
The beldam saith: “The hearth, by it
With measured step and even gait
On guests their servants used to wait
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
This he believed: a kindred spirit
Allure the young gallant
In the unmoved, magnificent
Who would the maiden innocent
That Heaven her character had blent
Ne’er touched her fingers indolent
Bringing his partner corpulent
Shines in the female firmament
Awakens secret merriment
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
The limits of enlightenment
Having this mournful document
But now—none heeds the monument
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Their heroes used to represent
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
But enough! Now, ’tis my intent
So Tania to her heart’s content
In course of time (the whole extent
Time was, in style magniloquent
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Not so! My Moscow never went
Onéguine to the window went
Imploring looks and mute complaint
But strength of mind and self-restraint
A forest now she sees in front
In spite of common sense we’re wont
Spite of herself with Lenski’s lot
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
Into the district then to boot
And meditative from the spot
Just manages a feeble trot
Into the chamber where he slept
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Rekindled in my withered heart
But the young unpolluted heart
Confessions which a trusting heart
Method was dear unto his heart
How well he played the greenhorn’s part
But Fortune cast our lots apart
Then touching Olga they depart
And oft in whispers would impart
Their voices nought to her impart
Poetic transport. They impart
Anew the flames of passion start
Eugene designed with me to start
And, by the way, I here assert
To accompany him and to escort
An infant maiden doth exhort
When the obedient doll in sport
Like a Bacchante in her sport
There is no fishmarket retort
She buries deep within her breast
“I weep. And if within your breast
’Twas she who first within his breast
And about dawn upon his breast
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
I by the button-hole seize fast
A flimsy trace of musings past
But this is my advice, ’twere best
No sense was ever manifest
Just so! that modest swain is blest
And grant his weary bones their rest
Now with what eager interest
By fond illusions once possest
But first permission did request
With this immoderate request
Their idols they were wont to invest
With what avidity and zest
She led me through nocturnal mist
Their own productions, some insist
No greater pleasure can exist
That every morn at Verrey’s cost
O’er all a sheet of silvery dust
Who words and actions will adjust
For, from the outset, ’twas unjust
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Can we not stealthily make out
Lenski his pencil-case took out
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
The wind rose instantly, blew out
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Of creditors a hungry rout
Demands that I translate for you
But with austerity!—for you
“But, mátushka, to Moscow you
And now upon the snow in thaw
The time when Melancholy’s claw
I have known beauties cold and raw
When in that company she saw
He in imagination saw
Because he yawned at the bare view
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
Russia’s Terpsichore review
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
My little book. With thee I knew
(Though certainly mankind he knew
But upon all that Eugene knew
And by degrees upon him grew
And soon imagination threw
Nearest and dearest knew not how
Villages in the distance show
Morning’s forerunners, breezes blow
Park, garden, palings, yard below
All the creations which below
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
Where plentifully feelings flow
They sat, but conversation’s flow
Whose countless golden crosses glow
The unaffected traits she now
Its insignificance I know
And in the morning doth not know
“Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
The bee forth from his cell of wax
In this the love of the fair sex
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
Chained to his bedside night and day
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
What, invitations? The same day
Beside the stormy sea one day
And in reality one day
Listless is she the livelong day
In cruel solitude each day
In haunts of fashion where each day
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Yet on a frosty winter day
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
No senseless fashionable lay
How sick to death his uncle lay
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Unto the hero of this lay
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
The bridegroom sage without delay
Lo! through the frozen windows play
To make wise men the idiot play
Cunning already to display
’Tis there that arrant fops display
He would not that a man ye slay
But the dark sepulchre I may
Some army poet therein may
That grandmothers and grandsires may
And though perchance a lady may
Let us congratulations pay
Curtly announcing for the fray
Which rushed in eager dense array
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Tattiana purchased with a stray
So frequently his mind would stray
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Horror! had she not better stay
His furs are powdered on the way
Impetuously clove its way
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
How oft the kindly Muse away
The mystic lines to tear away
And to Onéguine far away
But borne in spirit far away
But Summer swiftly fades away
It whiled his idle hours away
With serious air then went away
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
Onéguine sat the table by
No trace ye left in passing by
At table she was sitting by
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
Nor by her sister’s brilliancy
And (elbows on the table) they
To consanguineous dinners they
Eventually petrify
When on the pallid eastern sky
The nights of golden Italy
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
At morn I must assuredly
And now we hear delightedly
What agitation languidly
But not at present, though sincerely
Took aim—but as immediately
The evanescent fashions fly
Unto the gates the servants fly
Alas! life’s hours which swiftly fly
I like this word exceedingly
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
And like Childe Harold gloomily
And the far mountains daintily
Terror assails her. Hastily
So from the mountain lazily
God save his soul eternally
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
The reaping girls approach and ply
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
Or into bold hands anxiously
“Then send your grandson quietly
Then he’d malign them secretly
Turned to her and discordantly
Oh! I accept. And instantly
Grasped a long knife and instantly
She cannot—then impatiently
Around her neck, now violently
He brought from mystic Germany
But who in that choice company
Then be it so! My destiny
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
There is no stupid calumny
She loved upon the balcony
Into the study of the boy
In idleness and tranquil joy
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
The feeble moment would espy
And following them ye might espy
But more the passions occupy
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Dark shadows thicken—a dread cry
But scarce had sleep’s soft witchery
The clue unto some mystery
With ardent sighs and flattery
Sed alia tempora. And bravery
He feared the criminal might try
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Byron’s capricious phantasy
By the sick lady’s gaiety
Before such fond simplicity
Yet with a feigned frigidity
And then with blind credulity
But grant with magnanimity
I will with thy divinity
It carries of antiquity
With us ’tis quite a novelty
Also my wretched liberty
Of tender years the modesty
And heard a voice cry—Why! He’s killed!—
Lenski as a good match received,—
The wood she enters—bear behind,—
Of late I have been quite absurd,—
Where the first time I saw your face,—
Impressed him in the least degree,—
The letter is the thing, you see,—
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,—
Or bosom full of languid fire,—
For my wild garden and bookcase,—
To whom your hearts were consecrate,—
Trembles upon my lips from spite,—
And ease and fashionable waste,—
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,—
Where all upon the surface lies,—
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,—
Above the yawning grave would fight,—
When in as instant she is lost,—
And Tania’s husband soon appeared.—
An ancient lady full of grace.—
She sank.—
“My darling child, thou art in pain.—
Tattiana—thus the sex is born.—
I’ll sprinkle thee with holy water.—
But could not. Then she questioned him:—
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?—
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?—
What they in conversation said?—
Wherefore am I your quarry held?—
An ardent heart and yet so mild?—
That I am rich, a prince’s wife?—
Was he in health and void of care?—
No novelty—is it not true?—
I love you—to what end deceive?—
Me now, inflict upon me pain?—
Is petted by the Emperor?—
Where I can no more recollect?—
But now—what brings you to my feet?—
But trusted the ideal she wrought?—
A timid love to banishment?—
Obeyed the impulses of heart?—
Like you and me and all the rest?—
He back as from a sudden blow?—
She fears she cannot.—Cannot? Why?—
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead—
With shame I shudder and with dread—
And two old pines their branches spread—
It may be that I did proceed—
Not all will like myself proceed—
She seeks the garden in her need—
Nay, near—but destiny decreed—
A breathless silence then, prolonged—
What visions then her fancy thronged—
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed—
By a rich pie were occupied—
A life of fact, not fiction, led—
He conversation would have led—
She consolation thence obtained—
I mused: perhaps the matter’s squared—
As Saadi anciently averred—
Some Russian authors he perused—
They long at home have her expected—
And when her violence reviewed—
My pretty self-deceiving maid—
Scornfully challenged you afield—
Heard he the truth? And thus she could—
Of a strange night when the moon and—
A weary season was at hand—
Gazing on Lenski’s corse did stand—
Farther Tattiana’s walks extend—
Until her heart less high should bound—
And if Tattiana mine had found—
Debate commanded ample food—
She enters a deserted yard—
Command him not to say a word—
That girl—but he must dreaming be—
I would desire my bride to be—
Time will the ravages efface—
And my Eugene the path must trace—
Tattiana learns the intelligence—
And aimless journeys did commence—
I cannot tell on what pretence—
Not to behave as he did once—
Were I like you a bard by trade—
On horseback every day they ride—
But I am now another’s bride—
In consultation stand aside—
A pair of bullets—nought beside—
Secure in rural quietude—
Displayed a noble rectitude—
In many things had changed his life—
Or faults of grammar on its page—
Before you agonized to die—
And silently I here must die—
The fever of the blood to slake—
And Lenski followed—a light broke—
Thus we began our little tale—
They crack a feeble joke and smile—
But will not modify a tittle—
Athwart the snow four paces came—
Her shoulder—Olga swiftly came—
That vicious set whom I don’t blame—
She waits, on fire her trembling frame—
He wakes—they with a letter come—
Callous to all on earth become—
Give me just half a glass of wine—
Of the cup brimming o’er with wine—
All to the grand saloon are gone—
Upon her brow sits wrath alone—
’Tis dreadful—ye agree, I hope—
Had bid her sigh for without hope—
And spouted it with lyric fire—
They growl a bit—they scandalise—
Olga the tea must supervise—
Man—forty years long in this wise—
The windows whitened, shutters close—
And also that my feeble verse—
Of friends the grateful intercourse—
One instrument for his own use—
I married—now, I supplicate—
And grasp a stirrup fortunate—
Must be pronounced unfortunate—
My soul I cannot renovate—
The vestibule finds empty quite—
He called upon me Christmas Eve—
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave—
The moderns of the ancients rave—
And enmity and hope and love—
The all-entrancing joys of love—
With tears which secret sufferers love—
When the hour came to bid good-bye—
Extinguished ashes do not blaze—
“The date, his fleeting years how long—
Enough! my pack is now unslung—
How meekly then I heard you preach—
No coquetry was there, I vouch—
You o’er your wine insulted hath—
The last poor obol I was worth—
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick—
Was uttered, and the cabin shook—
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail—
The lady’s glance upon him fell—
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell—
“The family are all quite well—
This separated us as well—
You fall in love again. But still—
Perchance they laurels also cull—
You know that I am now a fool—
He was a dear delightful fool—
He used to hate—and was no fool—
Conventionality’s dull tool—
’Twould serve ye in an epigram—
Providence otherwise may deem—
With mute appeal to ask they seem—
Writ in my honour now and then—
Onéguine—take him up again—
A case of books he doth obtain—
Pardon I ask for such a sin—
Of foreign whims the impersonation—
And eye which gleams with inspiration—
Thy meditative incantation—
’Tis silent—on her shines the moon—
Sailed silently in unison—
And sallied forth one brilliant morn—
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown—
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown—
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go—
“And is it she? It must be—no—
The maids beside Tattiana keep—
Her path across the plain doth keep—
And since I pulled thee by the ear—
Since in these arms I thee did bear—
The path of hope and tender fear—
Two dressed in uniform appear—
Never for me to reappear—
To lawless love I should prefer—
Aye bids ye in some way or other—
To clank the spur, delight the fair—
Around the carriage of the pair—
I blame not your behaviour—
Still of his club he member was—
And all that from thy hand proceeds—
Triumphs—their own or those of friends—
And wild among them grew her words—
The unbidden guests he roughly chides—
Sits down and gazes on all sides—
Of migratory gipsy hordes—
Had come both friends and enemies—
To bear love’s parching agonies—
My splendid house and gaieties—
Whom pale Diana’s ray illumes—
He fixedly upon her stares—
And slowly life coagulates—
The time between the wolf and dogs—
Calmly her eyes encounter his—
Of conversation, thought and aims—
His kneeling posture he retains—
Her weary eyes are filled with tears—
Trembling he seeks the young princess—
Thus oft—this I myself confess—
“If the domestic hearth could bless—
“’Twas possible then, happiness—
All that the heart would fain express—
A strong resemblance these possess—
Can count the time without much fuss—
The drive becomes monotonous—
His watch, the sun in turn he views—
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows—
We called to mind our youthful days—
Age immature averse to cheat—
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet—
And we—an unattractive set—
“Then amongst strangers I was left—
Of consolation all bereft—
Aurora’s ruddy rays of light—
Was withered ere the morning light—
Lay languishing both day and night—
The moon, the stars, and shining night—
The goblet still is bubbling bright—
Though by an error and unsought—
Must take a walk and rest a bit—
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit—
The snow upon the streets doth melt—
Now it is ready to be sent—
Long since I held thee at the font—
What once I knew is clean forgot—
By flattery and lover’s art—
And ease the tortures of the heart—
The fires of passion and its smart—
The fatal hour had come at last—
Heart would not throb albeit in jest—
Let us go seek a little rest—
So many neighbours here exist—
By their own horses, not the post—
See, I can hardly crawl about—
Unto a carping world must show—
To the youth Eugene hurried now—
Till January fell no snow—
And wholly occupied his day—
She was as heedless and as gay—
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay—
Was drawn, ideal of my lay—
Arrange without the least delay—
To see his Olga ere the fray—
Almost became a poet say—
But thoughts meander far away—
Unto her husband, went away—
What say you? to the family—
To all she answers cruelly—
“And he—but of him presently—
The artifice of villany—
She strains her throat to force a cry—
Will pass; the same to-morrow try—
By his embarrassed dignity—
As giddy youth’s hilarity—
“Not in the least, assured am I!”—
Zaretski shouted: “Why, he’s killed!”—
“Whither away? Deuce take the bard!”—
“Advance!”—
Of the horizon she is like!”—
“Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!”—
“Princesse, mon ange!”—“Pachette!”—
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!”—
“The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!”—
Of every sort and every set!”—
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,”—
With many a vacancy, ’tis said.”—
Hard by the window took her place.”—
About the rain and flax and cattle.”—
“He hath neglected us of late.”—
To guess how you the eve pull through.”—
“My heart’s delight, thou art not well.”—
Present me.”—“You are joking.”—“No.”—
“Good-bye, Onéguine, I must go.”—
“Oh! I remember, where is he?”—
Straight from their province had he come?”—
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?”—
“The left? Why, what on earth is there?”—
Thus to assassinate the eve?”—
Would whisper: shall I so long live?”—
Were you in love when you were young?”—
“How now, Onéguine, yawning still?”—
“How came you then to wed a man?”—
Shall I behold thee once again?”—
By whom the youthful bard was slain?”—
“I’m happy, say, is it not so?”—
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?”—
And I to give thee cakes was wont?”—
“Who? Is it that stout general, pray?”—
“Command me, darling, what you choose”—
But fools—their calumnies and sneers”—
“No misery I see in that”—
“Tania, my eldest child, you know”—
Ah! he has gone the other way”—
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!”
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!”
“What can be done? She is no child!”
“Your second you have left behind!”
“Warm yourself here a little space!”
“Aline!”
Is it for long?”—“Ma chère cousine!”
“Abandon hope for ever here!”
“How dull you are this morning, nurse!”
“Alas! my friend, no revenue!”
His son is married, just conceive!”
“Oh! how our years are vanishing!”
I am—in love—you know—don’t tell!”
When will the devil take his own!”
“The younger, you’re in love with her!”
’Tis yes! no! never madam! sir!”
In old age life is weariness!”
“Look quickly to your left, my sweet!”
“I with my friend intend to fight!”
Alas! how wretched now my lot!”
Deep in our mother Earth’s chill breast!”
’Tis a scene of romance, I vow!”
“Bring dinner now without delay!”
“What! Grandison?”—“Yes, certainly!”
Will you?”—“Agreed.”—“I thank you, friend,”
He hies unto the “Boulevard,”
“He promised here this day to ride,”
Who early died a gallant death,”
Swift following in her wake, the sun,”
“Shall we commence?”—“Let it be so,”
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.”
Grant that I err not on the road.”
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.”
The deuce with my inside has played.”
Had killed me had the like been told.”
If not, the money I will lend.”
For ever faithful will abide.”
The house and garden I would see.”
You choose.”—“But who is she?”—“My wife.”
“The post hath kept him, it is like.”
Onéguine waits on us, ’tis like.”
Open the window—sit by me.”
But look you—ah! do not refuse.”
But send your grandson before long.”
Repose in peace, thou child of song.”
And led me off to church with song.”
Incessantly his chains to break.”
They have invited you this week.”
Whom you in slumber may have seen.”
Approach, approach; I am thine own.”
“Is he known to you?”—“Yes and No.”
He’s a straightforward little chap.”
And dost thou know her?”—“We live near.”
Long ago?”—“’Tis the second year.”
And lonely through the forest creeps.”
He cannot give me happiness.”
I mean my name not to repeat.”
They will receive us with delight.”
“I am in love, nurse! leave me now.”
Society he duped enow.”
That he was “ready any day.”
Relate some ancient history.”
“Say, of the two which was Tattiana?”
And what will Destiny concede?”
“Can I inspect the mansion, please?”
But why are your cheeks whitening?”
Merciful God, what will he deem?”
“Why did you leave last night so soon?”
Cousin, rememb’rest Grandison?”
Am I to go through the whole list?”
“Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?”
And hat surnamed a “Bolivar”
But I perceive thou dost not heed—”
In times gone by thy bare command—”
“I call to witness God on high—”
“Boredom, my friend, behold the ill—”
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain—”
